30 September 2022,Terrific!!,9.0,WandaVision is the first of the Disney shows that take place in the MCU. I need to start off with my praise for Elizabeth Olsen and the job she does here. She's not only beautiful but she's such an underrated actress. She really is one of the better actresses working right now. Wanda is one of the most powerful superheroes in the entire MCU and it really shows here. It's a weird and very fun show that will keep you entertained throughout the series. The attention to detail really captured the era and is a fantastic tribute to to the sitcoms of that era. If you're a fan of the MCU then this is a must watch!
31 January 2023,Elizabeth Olsen is amazing here!,9.0,I found WandaVision to be a pretty entertaining show that's a fantastic addition to Phase 4! It's so over the top bananas but it works in a weirdly entertaining way! Once you start watching it you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. I don't understand some of these negative reviews though...did you not watch the trailers? Some of you are acting surprised at what you were watching. I don't get it...what were you expecting that you didn't get to see? It's a wildly original show that's such a fun ride that you can't turn away and that absolutely pays off in the end. Elizabeth Olsen is so amazing here that she absolutely deserved an Emmy nomination! She was also just great and the best thing going in the new Dr. Strange movie!
29 January 2021,Ignore every negative review before episode 4,10.0,"It might have been an error on Disney's part to release only the first 2 episodes at once instead of 4 episodes. While I am on of the few people who absolutely loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes, this exceptional show has been getting a lot of hate due to a lack of plot.

... And then the 4th episode came out. Not only was it an exceptional episode, but it justified the use of the first three and even gave some answers to the many questions of Wanda vision.

Overall a brilliant show that shouldn't be judged on the first three episodes (especially if your only complaint is a lack of plot)"
18 October 2022,An unexpected experience,7.0,"First of, I'm not a Marvel fan, not into comics and superheroes at all, so please read this review as what it is: an outsider's point of view. I watched this show, because I saw the trailer and the obvious homage to classic television appealed to me. All those shows paid tribute to and mentioned, I like. The way the main character related to them affected me. The cast was great, the humor a lovely surprise. The villain, well, not exactly my cup of tea, but as I said, I have no background in this universe, so I won't go into further detail. What I loved beyond words was the attention to detail and the visible love expressed for TV history from The Dick van Dyke Show to Malcolm in the Middle. Now that hit a nerve and made me smile all the way through, love story included. I'm still positively enthralled."
13 March 2021,all the missing emotions,8.0,"Avengers, Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), are somehow starring in variations of old TV sitcoms.

This delivers all the missing emotional content in this Avengers cinematic coupling which never achieved actual feelings while on the big screen. In the movies, Wanda and Vision always felt slapped together. They don't have much screen time and even less emotions. After all, one is a brooding terrorist turned good and the other is a robot humanized. They are powerful magical beings rather than a human relationship until now. This time, Marvel has decided to expand what was probably an interesting movie into a nine episode TV show. In expanding it, it allowed various scenes to give these two character real human emotions. It places Wanda's grief front and center as well as highlighting their relationship. More than all the movies, this show puts real meat on the bones of these characters. It finally makes them flesh and blood.

Warning: At least watch it to episode four. The surreal first three episodes can be confusing and leave one wondering about unfamiliar sitcom tropes."
6 February 2021,Wandavision is kewl.,8.0,"Show is developing nicely and although the build up is slow, by episode 5 the story progresses more and gets interesting. World building seems good, characters are solid and there's an eerie vibe in every episode which makes it intriguing.

Also, this show is somewhat different; many double meanings and implications. Feel free to interpret. Wandavision is already a pun.

On another note, I am happy to see many actors from various MCU films appearing. Also, the core cast of this show is pretty good (see Kathryn Hahn) and OlsenBettany are given a nice chance to show some more acting skills and deliver comedy on top of the drama and action that we are used to.

So, its an 8/10 for now, looks like a novel show. Give it a go."
4 February 2021,Gets better with every episode,10.0,
10 March 2021,"Not as bad as some say, not as good as some others say",7.0,
26 February 2023,Refreshingly Creative,8.0,"A refreshing and creative television series. This series with its first two episodes almost sluggishly slow only to later pick up speed breaking new ""immersive"" ground in the superhero genre. Somewhat difficult to understand at first but quite unexpected, funny, and enjoyable, the comedic nature of this series eventually makes way for dramatic superhero action with heart-wrenching end. The various plot themes, from past television comedy series, to mysterious military thrillers, paranormal powers that border on magic make for a difficult script writing effort. The script though almost nearly becomes a seamless continuous television experience. The use of flashbacks and editing at times become worrisome in their approach but actually somehow redeem themselves quite well with their intentions reflective of great scriptwriting. All the loose ends almost magically come together with so many storylines explained and offering nice understanding of how individual characters fit with each other and themselves. Overall, this series becomes edgy and eventually introduces emotionally charged philosophical and humanistic quandaries. Definitely worth watching."
5 March 2021,Have a comic book geek on hand to help you fill in the blanks if you are a person like me.,8.0,
23 February 2021,Interesting premise with a boring padding.,5.0,"WandaVision certainly have a very intriguing premise, but pretty much everything else, like the build up to the interesting parts, is a tacky snore. The first three episodes is pretty much just a homage to old sit-coms, but unfortunately they weren't able to make those parts ...you know ...funny. So they merely function as a boring transportation device to the mentioned interesting parts. Couldn't they hire some actual funny sit-com writers for those parts and make them good instead of necessities? Unfortunately when the intriguing more ""serious"" parts kicks ins, it feels like even those parts of the show gets stuck in some kind of stale combination. When you feel like ""Ah, here we go!"" it doesn't really go. Is it suppose to be funny still or more serious? Either way, it's not very good at being any of those things."
22 March 2021,An Interesting Concept But Overall A Mediocre Show,4.0,"This could have been a lot more interesting, but unfortunately this is another mediocre and overrated show.

The concept isn't bad, but most of the series is boring and despite the episodes being short, they seem too long.

The last two episodes aren't that bad, but it's just not enough to make the series anything more than mediocre entertainment that isn't really worth spending time on. Today, most hows are unimaginative and boring, and this one is no exception.

Maybe there are just too many movies and series about superheroes, so nothing can impress us anymore.

The cast is good and it's a shame that the script isn't as good. The cinematography is excellent, but that is simply not enough anymore, the special effects are not enough to make the show interesting. Unfortunately, another in a series of mediocre generic TV shows.

In short, another mediocre show with slightly better special effects."
3 February 2021,For once the hype is well deserved.,9.0,"I've become a little suspicious about so called hyped up shows, but, to my sheer surprise, WandaVision really is a great show.

You will need to stick at it, the first few episodes were a bit of a chore, but once all settles down, which is pretty much at episode four, it becomes a cracking watch.

It's rather difficult to review the show as a whole, because the quality of episode does vary a little, however for the sheer imagination, acting and general originality, I have to score it a 9/10.

Don't be put off by the first couple, it really does go up a notch.

It delivers."
21 February 2021,It's alright,6.0,"I'm sorry for the 7/10 review, but I've been watching some amazing (in my opinion) 10-star shows and it just doesn't seem that great once I watch the next coming episode. Yes, I probably watch too much tv in my free time but I just love movies/shows and casting my reviews. I think Olsen is great but maybe needs a bigger challenge and will probably have one someday! It's just an ""alright, decent show"" that entertains in the moment of watching in my opinion. There's nothing too spectacular or thought provoking like shows I've watched elsewhere. Thanks for reading :) -Sina"
5 March 2021,Finally,5.0,"I knew after the last episode I would want to give the series a 10 but it doesn't deserve it by having a great finale, there were 2 episodes midway that were enjoyable but the quality slipped again after, it seemed the episodes were 4/5 filler material and 1/5 plot which was annoying due to the low run time and 9 episodes and being a limited series, the only exception to this for me was ep 5,6,9 I think a lot of the hype around this is the fan theories that happened every week which were more fun then the show tbh, and the fact it's the mcu so you have to watch it because it will tie in with the movies

On the plus side the 3 great episodes were great start to end which was upsetting because the quality was there and could have been in all the episodes, I know it was a string along show for week to week but the huge epic payout wasn't even there.

I'm not a hater of this show I just feel it could have been so much better, for people that want to know the main parts for the movies, I'd watch the last 2 episodes."
15 January 2021,Credits way too long,10.0,After two episodes I'm hooked and excited how things will unfold. But 7 minutes of credits is a bad joke. This time should better be used for more content of the show.
25 January 2021,Overwhelmly dull,5.0,"The sitcom bits aren't funny, the mystery isn't mysterious. I've watched ep 3, but I have no idea how I lasted this long."
18 April 2021,WandaVision is bad TV. Literally.,2.0,I wanted to like this show. But the first 90 minutes are nonsense. That is an eternity for nothing to happen in TV. What follows that is mostly a badly written show with a pretty lame final showdown. I do feel that both the actors did well with their roles. But they both really did unheroic things in the show. I respect they tried to do something interesting - but the Star Trek TNG episode with the similar plot where the alien had built paradise for his dead loved one was much better TV. This show makes me not want to watch Marvel TV.
16 January 2021,Don't give up on it,9.0,"I almost quit watching about halfway through the first episode. It seemed kind of silly and over the top. However, this all changes when the show starts to take on dark and perhaps sinister undertones. I think this series will be a mystery that slowly starts to unravel with each episode."
18 June 2022,One if the best things Marvel have done.,8.0,
8 April 2021,Overhyped average show,6.0,It starts slow and a bit strange but the story starts to improve and it gets good well up until Agatha Harkness the the whole story just becomes stupid. There was no need it was ok as it they road it was going. You do not always need a dumb twist and this is dumb. It spoiled the whole story.
8 February 2021,Wow wow wow wow wow and Wow,9.0,"Bear with the first 3 episodes, you will find a crazy creative TV show!!!! I almost gave up and wondering what happened to Marvel, this is a studio that had made so many amazing movies.... then the 4th episode came and explained why, it's a very complicated story and an absolutely innovative TV show that not a chance you had seen something like this before. Just hold on to it, it's the Marvel, they're trying something new for TV shows, it's a bold try and they wont let you down. Only 9 stars cos the end credits last for crazy long 5 mins... sweating!!!"
26 March 2021,A somewhat acquired taste is required here...,5.0,"I sat down to watch the 2021 series ""WandaVision"" after having been told that it was really good, and also the high rating here on IMDb seemed to deem it a great show. And with the creative force of Marvel behind it, what could possibly go wrong?

Well, I have to admit that ""WandaVision"" fell somewhat short of properly entertaining me. It was just the whole concept of the storyline that threw me off, as I found it so hard to buy into it and take it seriously. Oh for sure, this wasn't really bad, but it just didn't really appeal all that much to me. Yet, I managed to endure all episodes and watch it to the end.

Granted, then it should also be said that I am not overly keen on the whole concept of superheroes, but I still watch it, as it does tend to be somewhat entertaining, albeit often mindless entertainment.

It should be said that you literally have to suffer through half the show before things start to become interesting and escalate. And that was definitely something that killed off the show for me as well.

Visually then ""WandaVision"" was as you would expect from a Marvel production. Lots of high end special effects, great sets and props, and wonderful costumes. And the CGI effects throughout the course of the episodes were just spectacular, as it tends to be in the stuff that comes through the Marvel studios.

""WandaVision"" had a very great ensemble of cast members. It was definitely a blast to have Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany return to reprise their roles as Wanda Maximoff and Vision respectively. But aside from them, the series also had an amazing performance from Kathryn Hahn, and she really impressed me quite a lot here with this series, she is so much more than just a generic comedy actress. And I will say that Kathryn Hahn actually makes the show quite durable to watch. And it was also a blast to see actress Debra Jo Rupp in the show.

I really wanted to like this series and submerge myself into it, but it was just so difficult, especially with the first 5 episodes being so, well, ridiculous, for a lack of better words. I must admit, though, that the last episode was quite interesting, but by then it was just too little and too late.

My rating of ""WandaVision"" settles on a mediocre five out of ten stars. The show's storyline and plot was just a swing and a miss for me. But the visuals and acting performances made it bearable to sit through. However, I am sure that the show is appealing to the hardcore fans of the Marvel universe, I mean, just look at the rating of the show."
2 April 2022,Give it a Chance,8.0,"Great series. The first three episodes are a little strange, but it gets really good once things are explained and turns into a great Marvel series. There are some really good characters introduced and a very interesting story. Worth the watch."
28 June 2023,Comfortably Numb,8.0,
19 March 2022,Woah,10.0,"This is one of the best pieces of Marvel TV we've gotten in years.

Should you be aware of the MCU before viewing this? Yes, definitely, if you're not you'll be very confused, I've heard so much hype for this show and a lot of mixed reviews, it didn't really look interesting to me but after watching every episode my opinion has gone way up, unpopular opinion but this is lowkey better than a big portion of the MCU including Iron Man.

WandaVision has one of the best and most compelling mysteries I've ever seen in a TV show, from the very first frame you feel something is definitely wrong, and the director had a great vision because he wanted you to figure things out as the show went on before revealing everything, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany do their best acting since Infinity war and Kathryn Hahn is incredible in this show, it was fantastic to see a real threat to Wanda and the show took Wanda and Vision in dark directions.

Vision having a philosophical debate with himself was one of the best things I've ever seen in the MCU shows, and all 9 episodes amount to one of the best and most epic finales I've seen in a long time.

This might be surprising for some people to hear, but WandaVision gets an A."
7 March 2021,Marvel fans: stop inflating this mediocre series,5.0,"(Disclaimer: I do not hate Marvel, I am just speaking objectively as a fan of cinema and TV - this is not a personal vendetta against Marvel.)

One line that stuck with me from this series was uttered by a background character, who begs, ""Please, let us go.""

This is the same sentiment I feel about Marvel's now vice-like grip on cinema and television: why can they not be content with releasing less often and with greater polish, rather than spewing out shows and films like they're going out of style?

Wandavision is, simply put, bang average to below-par television, a mismatch of clunky scripting and an ailing plot. It is so akin to the lower-end Marvel TV show predecessors (see ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."") that it is staggering to think that this is the most expensive series ever - all the more reason to think lowly of it.

Initially, I will admit, I was invested: the first two episodes are complete rubbish, wasting an hour of your time for about two minutes of storyline, but the hint was enough for me to persevere. By episodes three and four, my interest peaked as the story began to unfold, and between awful dialogue, something was actually unfolding. This is where the fun stopped.

The rest of the series devolves into comically bad television, predictable and uninspired. There are ""hidden"" niche references for the hardcore fans, but they are not accessible to the average viewer; instead, you get some VFX that wouldn't look out of place in the early 2000s, along with acting that can only be described as bad (all except for Paul Bettany, who is really trying his damnedest).

If the funding for this show was really $25m per episode, can you honestly say it looked that good? Game of Thrones, for example, had episodes twice as long as Wandavision with ten times the settings required and a lower budget, yet looked worlds better than this cringeworthy witch-fest.

Some of the fight scenes were bemusing, given the clunky physics and weird cuts used to ""enhance the action"". I understand the attempt at bringing back sitcom styles from the 50s forwards, and I did like this, but the novelty wears off when nothing else of interest is on show.

In reality, Wandavision is Disney's Mandalorian for the Marvel universe. It is sacrilege for superhero fans not to enjoy the spectacles aimed at them, so they assimilate these shows, even if they are rubbish.

Were this show unconnected to Marvel, and in fact just a new troop of superheroes with the same plot and acting, it wouldn't be heard of again (nor celebrated to begin with), such is the swaying power of Marvel these days. I would say to those who have watched this: take off the rose-tinted glasses, and watch this series again honestly and frankly.

Can you really say this is the pinnacle of television? The best I can say is that it's different - and even then, the individuality is lost by the second half."
17 April 2021,"Not the worst, but insanely overrated",4.0,"The first few episodes when it was still a mystery were the peak episodes, and even then, it was progressed in an abundance of mind-numbing sitcom skits.

As soon as the ""big twist"" was revealed, it got really bad. I feel like they couldn't live up to what they had built earlier on. It wasn't awful though, it still had its good moments, like every show typically does."
15 February 2021,Are you kidding me?,10.0,What is with the negative reviews? This show was beautiful and funny from the very first minute. I am looking forward to how they will evolve.
6 March 2021,"Slow start, decent middle, flat finish, good acting",5.0,"The first few episodes were quirky but uninteresting, the middle set of episodes were an improvement as it was clear something else was going on here and Marvel might take a risk for once, and then they went right back to the formula and ruined all the moving out of the comfort zone and interesting character potential

But Olsen and Bettany are fantastic"
11 March 2021,A pure set up for the next MCU movie instead of creating a world of it's own,6.0,"After the cinematic climax of Avengers, Marvel has reached it's pinnacle of excitement and despite their big plans, the movies were too spread out so they needed something to fill in the space between them. Seeing the success of the Mandalorian, the Mickey Mouse empire decided to try the same approach with their superheroes.

When WandaVision came out, it attempted to create some mystique by using a black and white sitcom style but unfortunately neither the flat jokes nor the quirky atmosphere made it interesting. As the episodes went on, the events began to make sense, the teasers were all over the place and the series became rather enjoyable by episode 4.

Everything was going upwards and the show looked like it might actually be something big that will crack open the next phase of the MCU but then they just bombed the ending. The resolution did manage to wrap up the story in an alright fashion but there was so much potential to make it a dramatic and truly emotional climax. Instead, they went for the usual ""Disney"" ending without any real weight; not to mention the countless red herrings that amounted to absolutely nothing. The second post-credit scene did add some pepper and the new costume looked sick but the show could have been so much more. Marvel needs to understand that a series has to have a satisfying conclusion; not a mere set up for their movies.

The show certainly turned out better than expected and if you manage to get past the initial episodes, it should be an enjoyable binge. Elizabeth and Paul put a lot of effort into their acting and the VFX did look formidable; I only wish that the writers would have tried harder. The more you think about the series and the questions that were left unanswered, the more frustrated will you get. Quite simply, the 9 episodes is a one time watch that was made only to fill the gap between the movies instead of creating an interesting project that fans would genuinely care for.

15 January 2021,So many questions...you people need to pay more attention,8.0,
22 March 2021,Liked the non-Marvel episodes,7.0,"I'm not a Marvel fan, but I liked the first few episodes simply because they are not Marveled! The idea was kinda original, although I had watched something similar in Mr. Robot, where Elliot was in old comedy show and laughters were in the background, I felt like it was the same idea especially in the beginning. But I liked the twist at the end, I laughed a lot."
21 November 2021,Amazing series,9.0,"First of all, series has funny moments as expected from the marvel Series. It is mysterious and all the mysteries solved in last episode which make you hold to this series. Then there is suspense also, story plotting with character development is fantastic - can't describe it. And credit scenes are also epic.

But there are some problems as well, like i am not familiar with english language but this series uses some hard words, you feel boring in start bcz of sitcom type. There are some mistakes as well. It is little bit confusing also.

That's all Hope you like it."
10 January 2022,Wanda's love gotta do with Vis?,7.0,"'WandaVision (2021)' picks up some time after the events of 'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' and initially presents itself as a sitcom. This makes the first two episodes a little difficult to engage with; they're fun enough in their own right, but they don't exactly grip you. As the series progresses, though, it soon reveals itself to have a strong overarching narrative that's actually really meta in a fairly interesting way. The episodes, even those that are clearly part of a wider story, are styled after sitcoms from each decade (starting in the 1950s and ending in the 2010s), until the show more-or-less drops this conceit for its finale. The finale itself is actually rather underwhelming because it introduces an antagonistic force that doesn't follow on from that which has been established throughout the show. Still, most of the affair is focused on character and that's where it really shines. Sure, it's cool to see how they adapt their desired story to fit within the sitcom framework, but the most impactful stuff certainly comes when its characters question their reality and are shown to be dealing with the ramifications of the events they underwent in their previous big-screen appearances. Though it gets off to a bit of a rocky start, this is a well-made and entertaining show. It's also rather distinct and explores its title characters better than any of Marvel's previous efforts. It's a good start to the television side of the MCU. 7/10."
16 January 2021,Kind of Hokey. Not Bad. Not Good. Just OK.,5.0,
7 May 2021,And I'll get your little dog too.,8.0,
7 March 2021,Had potential to be great,6.0,"Ok, I really loved the first three episodes, because they were different. It wasn't the typical marvel formula (which isn't a bad thing) of just action and fake science talk. It was a bit creepy at times, and was genuinely enjoyable to watch. Of course, those are the episodes people criticized for being 'boring', and using sitcom tropes. Well, the point of those episodes is that they were using sitcom tropes and putting a twist on it. You did watch it, didn't you? Anyways, after that, we start to see the typical MCU stuff, just without the action, so we just get fake science talk. I do like Jimmy Woo, though. Both of the villains are bad, especially the one that worked for S.W.O.R.D. (I can't even remember his name), so much fake science talk, and a lot of time spent outside the sitcom style. The sitcom style bits were really fun, that's why the first three episodes were so great. Also, the action in this show wasn't needed. I really didn't want this show to have a big action packed climax, but who am I kidding? It's a Marvel show. All in all, first three episodes 8/10, rest of it 5/10, I'd say that averages to about a 6/10 overall."
15 January 2021,"A Delightful Superhero Soap, unlike anything in MCU",8.0,"Part loving whimsical homage to Classic TV history, part off tantalizing kilter mystery, WandaVision is a wonderfully weird and strikingly bold step into the small screen for the MCU - and a perfect showcase for Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany. Marvel goes off on a bizarre and audacious twists and a world away from the usual explosions and super-punching yet confidently delivered tangent, bringing back familiar characters in a fresh and imaginative way. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany deliver the comedic goodies, as the series drops delightful comic book Easter eggs and it's mystery unfolds towards the phase 4 in MCU. Watching the first two episodes proved that the show is definitely expertly produced and spectacularly written with some beautifully performed twists on TV history, and Olsen and Bettany commit hard to the cheesy comedy. Wandavision is an extraordinarily different aspect to superhero genre."
17 January 2021,Double Meanings Everywhere,10.0,
7 March 2021,You can't take your eyes off it,10.0,"Westview, New Jersey. Present day. A charming suburb full of happy couples, all the men gainfully employed, every woman an ideal wife, not even one person causing problems. Why, the very worst thing you can say about anyone living there, is that some of them do enjoy gossip! So while things in the past have been tragic for now newlywed Wanda(Olsen, channeling Mary Tyler Moore, Elizabeth Montgomery, and Lucille Ball), surely things will be perfect and completely without conflict or pain now that she has moved here, with her darling husband Vision(Bettany, very Dick Van Dyke and Hugh Laurie), they will fit in, their children will be well-behaved, and they will finally, for once, have time together. However... I mean, at the risk of sounding distasteful... last time we saw, his head was... so what happened with that? And why is everyone... smiling so much? Making such corny jokes all the time? Didn't things used to be in colour, not black and white? I mean, if I didn't know any better, I would almost say that this feels like some twisted role-play... everything is like a sitcom, and which decade(each with its own catchy theme tune opening) it's from seems to keep changing... and then every so often, there will be a crack in this facade...

This is easily the least mainstream, most experimental, furthest away from their well-known(and depending on who you ask, more or less maligned) house style, that we have seen for the MCU so far. In some ways, it feels like it was made by David Lynch. Or something you'd see on The Twilight Zone. The mystery is incredibly compelling. You know immediately that something is definitely wrong. And since the people making this are completely aware that we're trying to figure out what is actually going on, and how, that we are carefully looking for any indication, they put in countless clues. So we're glued to the screen and listening carefully, for references to comic books, movies, TV shows, and then trying to figure out which ones are Easter Eggs and which ones are telling us what is happening and why. Hitting up Google and YouTube to see what we missed, talking to friends and coworkers about theories, convincing people who weren't already watching to do so, so they can participate in that. This is of course exactly what the people behind it hoped would happen, and they did an amazing job. Every cast member is spot-on in their complex, layered performances. Considering that this spans half a century of shows(and there is clearly a huge appreciation of those), this was a Herculean feat. They clearly did their homework. They are matched by the writers, the costume department, the set design, the cinematography. Keep in mind that, every so often, this will feature some real nightmare fuel.

I recommend this to fans of Marvel, and/or of the television series that this is a love letter to. 10/10"
6 March 2021,Interesting....,7.0,"This is a really cool and different show starring characters I'm already invested in. I had a great time for the most part. It's filled with intrigue that mostly pays off. I was debating between a 7 and 8. I went with a 7 because the first 3 episodes didn't hook me as much as they should have, and because of one major disappointment with a subplot involving an outside character that I can't make any logical sense of. But at many points I was absolutely loving the mystery and intrigue. (3 viewings, 3/5/2021, 4/28/2022, 11/8/2023)"
1 February 2021,If Disney dropped all episodes at once it would not get less than a 10.,10.0,"The only reason any one would give the series less than a 10 is that they had no idea what was coming. It's Disney's own fault they should Learn from Netflix. They should have dropped all the episodes at once. America loves binge watching. I watch the first 3 episodes and I was like what garbage is this? But patient was a virtue and I was well rewarded. It's starts at the end of episode 3, you will then realize what is really going on with this show."
6 March 2021,True to their .. Vision,10.0,"Should you be aware of the MCU before watching this? The three phases that came before this? Yes you should even if this starts off just like a very old time sitcom show. Even there having the knowledge of why and who the two main (titular) characters are is paramount (no pun intended - also maybe the next studio Disney buys?).

Of course this can be enjoyed even if you are not aware of anything prior to this. But even if it seems as too much, I think it is rewarding to go through the catalog. Of course if you weren't a fan before, it is likely you won't become a fan now. Especially those who are not patient enough might give up on the show after the first episodes. If so, you'll be missing out on quite something. Marvel took a (calculated?) risk to go back in time! But they did it in such manner that those who cherished those shows and enjoy being taken back into a different time will rejoice! Especially because it is done with so much love and care! The upcoming making of will shine more light on that.

For those already aware, mid credit scenes only become a thing from episode 7 onwards. So three episodes with an added scene, the last one even has two scenes! And they really make those who love the show want more. As of know it seems anything not resolved will be taken into a future MCU movie in Phase 4.

Enough callbacks and people returning to their roles but also many new characters introduced here. Some people, those aware of the comics may have some ideas of where those will be going ... but even if you can guess certain twists, the show which can be considered a very long Marvel movie, is very well made and has enough of everything to keep the viewers on the edge of their seat. I Wanda if you can see this Vision through? Very rewarding it will be (all puns intended)"
12 February 2021,"Too short, ended when it began to be interesting",8.0,
26 February 2022,Best Marvel Disney+ show,8.0,"So refreshing to see something so different in MCU. The sitcoms segments, especially the first three episodes were gold, which made the revelations much more effective than they could've ever hoped to be. There were moments were expositions were a bit too much, still, it worked pretty well. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are mesmerizing to watch. Even though they wasted some of the castings it was good to see the elaborate fan theories fail. Wanda became one of the most explored characters in the MCU, the only one that is probably explored a little more could've been Tony Stark but that was through years where they had to do retcons for inconsistencies.

However, WandaVision still had a lot more potential to become truly great if not for the bar MCU set that won't allow them to be more obscure. Still even this has been a pleasant surprise in the way it bent realities and tried to dabble at the boundaries of surrealism, not quite reaching there."
5 September 2021,One of the best series frm marvel,9.0,Except first two episode this series just awsm...I give this series 9 star..1star remove for frst two episode....wanda u r amazing...I just love her...
15 February 2023,THE Best MCU Show They've Made!,9.0,"This show pure entertainment and art from star to finish. Admittedly, if you're not into sitcoms, you may not like this show, but I LOVE sitcoms so this was already right up my alley.

But this is Sitcom meets Twilight Zone, meets MCU, meets romantic tragedy. This story does Wanda and Vision the justice that EndGame just didn't have time for in the grand scheme of things.

The acting is amazing, the sets and costumes are beautiful, the script is just...*chefs kiss*. Not to mention the very meta casting choice for Ralph. I actually can't think of a single con about this show and am pretty pissed at what Doctor Strange 2 did to Wanda and her character development."
25 August 2022,Creative but awkward,6.0,Marvel hasn't quite gotten their shows right. The episodes are a bit too overstretched with not much happening in each episode. There is a lot of forced humour that is extremely jarring and awkward. Most importantly it lacks this unifying soul. They all feel so much like people just acting but not like a real story with real people.

31 January 2021,They played a dangerous game,10.0,"The rating of this show as it stands is a direct result of the first 3 episodes. I, like everyone else was like; what in the world is this!? Again only the first 3 episodes. I had basically given up, but forced myself to watch the 4th outing. Oh boy was it worth the wait. It went from a joke to a solid 10 in a couple of minutes. So yes I think it's a dangerous game to play by the studio, even though you somehow felt that this couldn't be 'it'. I think a lot of people have given up. What a shame, because after ep. 4 you just know it's going to be a great show, high quality storyline and great actors. Can't wait for the next one."

Lots of unexplained plot points and boredom. The plus side is its not too long so not that much time wasted.

Sure, watch it but its nothing special."
29 March 2022,Agatha!,10.0,
5 December 2021,Fantastic show with excellent plot point,10.0,"Are you ready for a ride through the history of American television? Then WandaVision is a show for you!

Honestly, I did not expect that one of the first MCU series for Disney+ would be one of my most beloved series of all time. To some extent, this show is art on its own.

But let's start simple: Wanda and Vision live a happy life in a classic American suburban neighbourhood. Their life resembles a sitcom from, well, every century since television is on. Why do you ask? Find out yourself. It is difficult to not include major spoilers in a review. But I can tell you this: If you are familiar with the movies staring Wanda and Vision and know about the origin, you will quickly notice that something is quite off in this ""friendly"" neighbourhood.

The execution of the serious is unique and brilliant. The jingles for the sitcoms which carry the vibes of shows from their time are so catchy and are the cause for many nostalgia thrusts. While the first three episodes are quite slow in terms of story progression, you will quickly get the premise of the show. Up from this point, is a fantastic show with a splendid cast which deservedly won multiple Emmys for its performance."
19 February 2021,Originally a 4 but now 5 out of 10,5.0,"Yes, it picked up after Ep 4, but still not enough, into 6 I was bored again and started to wonder why I was hanging in there, it has moments of curiosity and artistic flare but also periods of basically nothing and waiting for another piece of the jigsaw, half of which are pretty predictable."
5 March 2021,House of Hmmm,7.0,"The first Marvel series for Disney+ is built on a fascinating concept but the closer it draws to MCU reality, the more turgid it becomes. The rich tropey world that WandaVision builds out of satirical sitcom interpretations is layered, clever and brilliantly realised but rather shows up the flat grey melodrama of the MCU aesthetic the more the latter intrudes. Despite the tonal disparity, that the strange Pleasantville/Truman Show premise was even greenlit at all is a minor miracle and it's a bold beginning to the corporation's plush filmic TV canon. It's glorious to see Bettany and Olsen flex their considerable dramatic muscles and both of them do a superlative job of grounding the show, whether in full epic comic movie mode or in whichever sitcom era they reside.

There's a rich supporting cast too and Hahn and Peters throw in spirited turns - the MCU comic reliefs seem a little snarky and superfluous in comparison, prized awkwardly out of their respective contexts but the whole strange ensemble is quite compelling. Also Photon was there as well. The pacing of WandaVision is quite uneven with a two-steps-forward-one-step-back approach born out of an obviously sincere but rather patronising desire to make sure the broadest possible audience is keeping track of the concept. It's the difficult tonal marriage of these two (somewhat conflicting) desires that prevents it from building too successfully on the promise of the first few unsettling installments and the flashy grand finale is somewhat of a grey superhero squib.

So certainly not bad but here's hoping the next Disney+ series is a bit more small-screen minded in terms of week-to-week episodic pacing, which would give the wider cast and entire series a bit more room to breathe naturally. What they sacrificed for consistency in the earlier parts was made up for by some truly subversive television which I wasn't expecting at all - so absolutely fair play to them for that and Make Mine Marvel always."
4 September 2021,"S.W.O.R.D. ruined it for me, everything else was perfect",9.0,"I had been thinking of watching WandaVision ever since it was announced, but it is only now that I finally got to watch it. And wow this is so good! I had wanted a Marvel show to be as good as a DC show, and this show is the one which finally reached that level (I haven't watched Falcon & the Winter Soldier and Loki yet so I don't know if they are also this good). I liked it so much that I watched the entire season in one sitting. I am writing this review as soon as I have finished the show, so everything is still fresh in my mind.

I have seen many reviews here saying that the first few episodes were bad, or the reviews which came after the first few episodes should be ignored. But personally that was what I liked so much about it. The problem with the show is that it was released weekly instead of just giving the entire season. If the latter was done so, it would have been really good. Seeing how Wanda and Vision are moving into a new decade of sitcom in every episode was actually a pretty good idea, and it would have been perfect if it was revealed slowly that this is a fake reality that Wanda had created.

And that is exactly where my problem comes from this show - S. W. O. R. D. I personally hate seeing the US Army in any superhero or sci-fi show. I don't know why but they have a very boring touch to them, like they are only normal people following orders. And there always has to be this one arrogant leader who will want to take down the protagonist just because he is weaker than them. Godzilla, Pixels, it never fails. And here they straight up gave the exposition. They weren't even needed in the show, and it would have been better if Vision slowly learnt about the reality and then Agnes explained everything. That would have been a much more shocking reveal. But no, they had to copy The Boys.

But other than that I liked everything else about it. Forget Marvel shows, I don't think MCU has ever gone this deep with their storytelling. It's a pity that the first Phase 4 film was Black Widow which was basically the opposite of what this is. The animation, the fight scenes, the acting, the plot twists - everything was phenomenal. I had already received too many spoilers about this show from The Film Theorist and Pitch Meeting, but still I went in and really liked it. The quality of this show is better than most MCU movies (looking at you Black Widow, I won't forget you this easily).

WandaVision is undoubtedly the best show Marvel has made, and most probably also the best show that had come on Disney+ Hotstar at the time. Unlike most good superhero shows like Doom Patrol, The Boys, Titans, Daredevil or Watchmen, this one can actually be enjoyed with the whole family. Although it's a pity that one has to watch all the 23 MCU movies to understand this show (not exactly all but one thing leads to another so yeah), but if you like Marvel and always wanted something about Scarlet Witch, absolutely go for it."
9 August 2021,A decidedly mixed bag-the show is hamstrung by the larger MCU,7.0,"The first 3 episodes of this series are simply delightful; they are funny sit-com episodes that effortlessly recreate classic sitcoms (i.e. Bewitched). They introduce the central mystery of the series with ease. The overall mixture of laughs and chills is deeply entertaining. Bettany and Olsen manage to turn-in great comedic performances along with more engaging dramatic moments. But unfortunately the solution to the mystery is both clunky and the writers seem unwilling to fully explore the concept.

Episode 4-where the storyline from outside Westview is fully integrated with the show-is where the problems start. The finale is very silly, very typical ""sky beam"" MCU but that resolution was implicit in how they decided to solve the central mystery. The show would have been better off simply making the mystery internal to Wanda without injecting other people into the mix. The show ends up being a trolley problem and there's a mechanical vibe to the plotting decisions. The show could have more time being a simple sit-com; in a real sense the plot ruins the atmosphere.

It is really a shame because much of the show is compelling. Wanda and her trauma are deftly handled to be emotionally resonant. Anything deal with the love between Wanda and Vision is striking. But much of the final third of the series is silly, pitched and too typically MCU for what the show set-up in its delightful first 3rd."
27 February 2021,This can't decide what it wants to be.,5.0,"WandaVision plays most of the time in a sit-com world comprised of sit-coms throughout the history of television. The idea is to show what it would be like to have Wanda and Vision as the leads in favorite sit-coms over the decades. This idea intrigued me to no end. I couldn't wait for the show to begin. Then it began and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Sit-coms are supposed to be funny and heartwarming and clever - this has none of that. The comedy is stale, the story is slow and the supporting characters have no significance whatsoever.

The interesting part of the show is the outside ""real"" world where they are trying to figure out what is going on but even these characters need work. As a Marvel show this is lacking any superhero qualities. As a funny show it is stale with no laughs. As a sci-fi show it is interesting for a few minutes an episode.

Maybe it will get better - I hope so.

Revision: After watching all shows my rating of 5 does not change. If they had started the show at episode 9 it would have been far more interesting. This is a shame since I have loved everything Marvel has put out before this."
16 April 2022,I love this series!,10.0,"How far would you go if you had the power to resurrect a loved one? When the couple moved to Westview at the start of the series, I assumed it would be about them trying to live a normal life in the suburbs. I didn't expect Wanda to create a false reality to fill her void of feeling empty and lonely. When Vision finally saw the reality and saw all the people suffering silently because their minds were being controlled, it was heartbreaking. I understand her logic, but Wanda was the villain; she caused a lot of harm to a lot of people for her own selfish reasons, and she may have had a long-term impact on a community. I had a feeling there was something odd about Agnes, she was prying neighbor always around for every situation, but I wasn't expecting her to be another witch after Wanda's magic, which was a nice twist."
29 May 2022,I love it because it gave different taste of other MCU movies,10.0,"I love this version of vision, i think Wanda is being more gentle here.. I just can't realize before that this version of marvel magic world could be this intriguing."
30 May 2021,WandaVision is one of the most creatives things I've ever seen,10.0,The story is so damn interesting. The humor is captured really well by the cast. It also does a good job on Wanda's character ark. There are some beautiful scenes in it. The score is also very well-made.
25 April 2021,So so,5.0,"It got better towards the end but the beginning was excruciating awful.

The two least interesting Marvel characters, well based on the movies in an tv shows probably sums up why they got a tv show show rather than a movie as they are boring.

The best thing about this was when Quicksilver from the Xmen films turned up.

It was dragged out over far to many episodes and it was awful to see how they just brushed over Wanda going all psycho."
16 January 2021,Anything that has half of it's votes rated as 10/10 is obviously faked,3.0,"Not even the best oscar winners every year have that much love. Mostly legitimate movies will have a curve in line with their ratings, this is chock full of 8,9, and 10's and then 10% are 1's. The actual reviews are highly suspicious as well, with loads of quick, one sentence reviews giving it a full 10 stars, from one review accounts. Amazing.

This show is nowhere near a 10 even if you love Marvel. It tries some different things to get creative but it just doesn't hold anyone's attention for long or create interest."
6 March 2021,They wasted the potential of series,5.0,
29 April 2021,WATCH PAST EPISODE 4!!!,8.0,Don't leave a review if you've only seen 3 episodes because you have no clue what's even going on yet. Finish the show.
30 May 2021,"""We are an unusual couple, you know.""",8.0,"I used to sit back when watching Avengers and think ""I can't believe we are seeing this on the big screen."" Years later, I still find myself thinking that, but now instead of 20 characters on screen fighting, it is the fun, mysterious and uncanny storylines that keep me intrigued. Comic book knowledge is not necessary, but it definitely amplifies the hype for this series. Can't wait for more MCU shows to arrive."
18 April 2021,NadaCognition,3.0,"This Marvel studio production is about two Marvel characters Wanda and Vision. The story revolves around them and the bizarre events happening in their life.

To a diehard fan of Marvel universe it might be seemed as an enjoyable tv series but for an impartial viewer the effort fall way short in becoming enjoyable. The story is so stale and pointless that it almost hurts your intelligence. The script was included with unnecessary characters with useless puns where it lacks basic logic in it. The screenplay was focused to stretch the scenes which dragged the story to unbearable extent. The good thing was the acting of the main characters while the supporting actors and actresses provided with an average performance.

Not recommended."
31 July 2022,A Wonky Ride,7.0,"An exciting and new take on Marvel, WandaVision is plenty fun. Starting off as confusing and odd, it progresses into a great show, with each episode having a different style in show history. The fans wanted House of M, they got something similar that they can be pleased with. Elizabeth Olsen has really developed a great character out of Wanda Maximoff, and seeing her evolution into the Scarlet Witch was honestly rewarding as a Marvel fan. Though they do make quite a few surprises, a couple characters were either pointless or upsetting. I hope Marvel makes amends to this in the future. This show is a wild, strange ride for sure, but worth it by the end."
20 March 2021,Fun and Heart wrenching,9.0,A lot of powerful moments in this show. As a whole I was one of the people theorizing and going online to see what others thought was going on. There was so much mystery and curiosity about it that it kept our family hungry for more. We would have probably binged it all in one sitting if we could. A truly great work.
5 January 2022,JUST WATCH IT,10.0,"I've been holding a two week MCU marathon and i've finally arrived at WandaVision After watching the first 3 episodes, i was confused and disappointed because i expected so much more and much different. However, after the 4th episode, i can see the genius behind the show's plotline and sequence of events. The show is also Incredibly well made, better than all MCU movies, and has an amazing cast.

I really appreciate the story and how the writers took their time with it to make a one-of-a-kind experience for marvel fans and comic books fanatics.

Can't wait to see what's further in store for Wanda!"
13 July 2021,A great show!,9.0,I loved how the first 3 episodes started off as a classic sitcom and then turned into a marvel type show! It turned out better then I thought.... Way better!
6 March 2021,Could of been better,5.0,Slow start like everyone has said which i understand helps build more of a back story but I believe it was dragged out way to much could of done 1 long episode not 3 short episodes. A few missed opportunities where the story could of went which would of made it so much better. The only reason I think people are loving it so much is because no marvel movies has been released in well over a year. Good points are the actors involved all of them did an incredible job with what they had to work with a couple of breakout roles for a couple of people and hope just the start of more screen time for the others. I think marvel need to just stick to movies.
6 March 2021,"Really enjoyed it at first, but a lackluster final knocked two stars off for me",8.0,"The show starts out very intriguing, and within a few episodes I was hooked. I looked forward to watching it every week and it exceeded my expectations every time. Except for the finale... Something about it just felt... off. I'm not sure if this was a different director this episode but the camera shots were really strange and the entire episode relied heavily on CGI which was fairly lackluster. Overall I'd say the serious is worth a watch if you're a Marvel fan just don't expect much from the ending."
9 January 2023,A sad story from Wanda,9.0,"The journey of a home life from Wanda Maximoff and Vision who have two twins, Billy and Tommy in Westview City with the appearance of a sitcom of various eras.

Season 1: WandaVision is a unique series and has a great visual with 9 episodes. Featuring several episodes combined with sitcom stories ranging from the era of black-and-white shows to color with a comedic feel that followed the era. WandaVision became an entertaining and moving series. The premise of the story is interesting by bringing the happy life of Wanda and Vision wrapped in comedy from black-and-white shows. A good, strong conflict. Wanda's personal conflicts that are able to be emotionally draining, moving and sad. Dense conflict in each episode. Each episode is capable of providing good mysteries and puzzles. The WandaVision series deserves appreciation, especially in terms of visuals. It is somewhat lacking in the story but still entertaining."
25 April 2021,Clever & fun till it goes all Marvel,7.0,
1 February 2021,This is funny,8.0,The show went from 7.5 to 7.7 after the 4th episode dropped. That's pretty funny.
6 March 2021,"And Again, And Again, And Again",6.0,"Plot: the first two episode... well, I don't even know why they did in this boring way. After those two there is an intriguing mystery that keeps your attention awake but it last not very long. The last part is just the usual Marvel stuff, everything already saw again and again.

Actress and Actors & Acting: the cast is not bad and I have to tell that Elizabeth Olsen is a very good actress and Paul Bettany too. Thanks mainly to them this show was not so bad.

Visual Effects: well, it's Disney, right? This is the only thing that they keeps it extremely good.

Soundtrack: it never goes out of tune, it's enjoyable.

Conclusion: another Marvel-classic story with nothing really new or original. I think that Marvel Universe is going to brim with all these stories. At least there are the main characters that are very good in acting!"
17 February 2021,An Unexpected Masterpiece- Everyone should watch it,10.0,"I'm not a very big fun of MCU. I like it, but not so much. But WandaVision is just incredible. This miniseries made me think that Wanda is the best avenger. What I like the most is how much dark this show is."
12 March 2021,Nothing Like You've Ever Seen Before,9.0,"""We are an unusual couple, you know."" ""Oh, I don't think that was ever in question.""

Now, before I begin, there are many opinions of this show. Many fans and people just introduced to the MCU have strong opinions which has made this a very divided addition to the MCU. Critically, it's been praised and there aren't many people who don't like it. But with the unique approach, some have been upset for such the high ratings. What I'm trying to say is I ask you to bear with me and respect my opinion. If you differ with it, there's nothing you can do to change my mind. The absolute masterpiece that is WandaVision blends the style of classic sitcoms with the MCU, in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision - two super-powered beings living their ideal suburban lives - begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems. From that teaser at the Super Bowl (I believe) over a year ago, this had been something exciting to look forward to. Literally no one knew what this would be about going in, really. I refrained from all trailers to go in as blind as possible. What I got was more than what I could imagine. Trying something new is what I've hoped for in the MCU for a while. As much as I do love a good majority of their movies, there's a fixed setup for almost all. WandaVision is something totally different and just what we needed. Had this been a show outside of the MCU, I think it would still be brilliant. Each episode is designed to go through a different era of television. How they handled it worked incredibly well. There's not a way of trying to modernize these old sitcoms from the 1950s and so forth, so it's like a replication of classic television. The sets, costumes, and camera lens and moment are amazing at doing so. One of my favorite games while watching is trying to see what show this episode was mainly based on. Accomplishing this couldn't have been easy and I applaud them for how they managed to get the feel of each era perfectly.

At the heart of this story are amazing performances. Elizabeth Olson hasn't had such an amazing display of acting since Martha Marcy May Marlene. So much emotion is put forth into Wanda that she is by far the most developed character in the MCU even if she came in late. There are some really heavy scenes and she portrayed those flawlessly. It doesn't feel much like watching a magical being, but we understand she's just another person in this world. Scene 8 showcases it all. Alongside her is Paul Bettany. With his character of Vision - a literal computer-god-being - it's hard to get complete range. He has such a good start with the series by delivering comedy. He's really funny in it (and Olsen too). Once the mystery starts to unfold, he builds more and more character until episode 5 when he unleashes his full capabilities. Never has Vision felt so human before. I'd also like to highlight Kathryn Hahn, because she's such an amazing actress. Playing the nosy-neighbor of Agnes must've been such a fun time. She takes up all the screen time she can get. I won't spoil a thing, but later on in the series she gets her moment - literally everyone's favorite moment - and you just love her even more. Teyonah Paris, Kat Dennings, and Randall Park also do well with their supporting roles. This is an ensemble piece for sure and the way they work off of each other shows dedication.

It's hard to discuss so much without spoiling because certain things do need to be addressed, but I shall refrain. Story is where people have been divided. Some thought it took way too long to get into, and I just don't see why. It's a series, not a movie, so setup is much different. And if it were to have moved on quickly, the mystery element would've lost its momentum. Every episode has some sort of question leading up to the finale. That's where fan theories came in and caused even more disappointments. I support fan theories, but I don't base my expectation on the rest of the show. Even if I had some hopeful thoughts, I never expected them to show up later on. With expectation, you can only be disappointed. My suggestion is to not have anything in mind when going in. Questions kept building and that's what made this the most gripping show I had seen in such a long time. I would stay up till 2 a.m. for the release of the new episodes because I just had to know what would come next. With a series, there was more time to develop and think about plot and character. Most importantly, though, there was enough time to build upon the past episodes and make an enjoyable time for both the sitcom moments and the Marvel storyline.

Sure, not every episode is as great as the one before or after. I don't think you'll ever find a show with each episode being perfect as ever. Take a highly regarded show like Breaking Bad. Many think of it as a perfect show, but it's not like they think every episode is perfect. To quote Steven Universe, one of my favorite shows, ""if every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hotdogs."" If every episode were perfect, it wouldn't have that range that it has. I don't grade a show based on each episode, but rather as a whole. And throughout the duration of WandaVision, I had an absolute blast. Marvel, Matt Shakman, and the whole crew made something unforgettable. I believe this to be the greatest thing the MCU has given us. There will never be a show quite like WandaVision. Only a few shows have gotten my perfect rating, and this ranks among them."

The changing of eras between each episode, made it stay fresh. I love that Marvel is finally giving the supporting characters their time to shine."

There is absolutely nothing like it out there. And I'm not even a Marvel fan.
15 January 2021,What!!!! 25 million an episode for this,1.0,"After watching first 2 episode I'm surprise how bad marvel what wanted to pull off an tv series inception but with even high budget and good actor this feels sloopy boring and needed more writer input Insteed they directly name this as original,unique,risky,bold etc lol"
16 October 2021,Impressive character development and creativity,9.0,"This is the creative swerve I've been long awaiting from Marvel. The characters of Wanda and Vision, in the past relegated ta a bizarre and obligated romance, are given the time and room to be developed into fully relatable characters. The mystery plot blends together many different styles of television within a reality bending Truman Show style conspiracy. The mind bending revelations and confusing episodes all relate to an emotional core that extends the inner life of Wanda beyond the cardboard cutout character she is in the movies. The main flaw, as far as I am concerned, is the cartoonish SWORD antagonist that seems to exist just to be evil and introduce far too many characters. Once we got to Hayward, White Vision and Agatha all threatening the family, the sense of intimate grief is lost and the series devolves into a thinly plotted blockbuster yet again."

21 February 2021,Trash,1.0,"I gave it a chance. I really did, but this is absolute garbage. The actual events take a back seat to the terrible 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s sitcom, reality TV, slice of life BS. The events in the usual Marvel world get around 5 minutes screen time compared to the aforementioned, cringe worthy crap. It shows no sign of halting, so I guess I'll take the lead and give it the finger."

1 August 2021,My Favorite Disney+ series so far,10.0,
1 June 2022,The power to make a good show.,7.0,"WandaVision is a good show. I enjoyed it in tremendous quantities.

I thought the two title character's (Wanda & Vision) where written in an excellent way. I loved the way Vision was introduced after Infinity War and how Wanda managed it all (and the complexities that come with her power).

I enjoyed the cameo (but no spoilers). Her children where a good addition but I didn't feel as much towards them as maybe I should've (especially towards the end).

I thought the main villains (The boss guy & the other one, no spoilers ;) where absolutely fine but nothing spectacular.

CGI - 8/10

Overall a good watch if you're in the mood for a little binge watch. I watched all episodes back to back and considering it's only 9 episodes it doesn't leave you wanting move or not having enough. I think it's in that goldilocks zone of runtime.

A good addition into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - 7/10."
28 February 2021,Very slow start.,8.0,
17 December 2021,First MCU television series in Phase Four that nearly change the MCU... Forever.,7.0,
13 March 2021,Jac Schaeffer puts on a clinic,10.0,Showcasing not only his considerable skills but in the process shows how to revive the Marvel TV universe - which imploded after its first lineup. Very clever. And Olsen finally gets the recognition she deserves. Win win.
9 April 2021,How ? Really how it got 8/10 ?,6.0,"I'm stunned, I don't why people have such a poor taste in tv shows. How possibly a stupid normal show got 8 out of 10 ? Not funny, not interesting and super boring...."
24 October 2021,Superheros with a twist,8.0,"That was something new for a change.

I very much enjoyed this!

Episode 1-7 i would actually give a 9, episode 8 and 9 get a 7. Bringing the average to an 8.

Everything up till the last two episodes feels authentic and original and then, unfortunately, it just turned into another (great) super hero series. All and all still really good though! Great and original writing (EP 1-7), amazing visuals and superb acting!"
19 September 2021,Most original MCU storyline yet,9.0,"It an age where everything you watch on TV or at the movies gives you a feeling of deja vu because every story idea has been done to death, this one will really throw off your expectations. Both of MCU fiction and of television in general. This is a highly original and creative story line which is also unpredictable. I loved every minute of it.

Even though I was confused for the first several episodes, I loved those episodes as well. Possibly because I grew up watching 60's and 70's television, and the look and feel of TV in that era has been recreated beautifully. But if you're feeling frustrated early on, you should definitely stick with it because it pays off and you will think differently of those early episodes. Good original storylines take some time to develop.

And thematically, the idea that people wishing to escape trauma, or even the banality of everyday existing, through escapism, has strong resonance. That theme has been covered before, but never with this much creative innovation.

This is now my second favorite MCU TV series after ""Daredevil."" 9/10."
13 March 2021,complete trash,1.0,"This might be worst the captain marvel. Didnt think it be possible but it is. Evan peters was wasted, and prob was the best thing here next to Kat Dennings"
17 June 2023,Perfect...,8.0,"What a delight to watch, the first episodes are as enthralling as they are unimaginable, those sitcoms in the 60s, creative, left me hypnotized at various times, I would not have imagined that something so different and strange would be so successful, in fact, I imagined that only I was me fall in love...

Perfect initial contrasting with failures and bugs in the course and ending with chaos disrupting all its perfection...

I love it when the series or even the movies focus on the hero's past life, mainly due to my poor memory and/or completely ignoring the character's life story... Great ending to an incredible series, probably for many, many years years this style of series will be unpublished, its confection, having to maintain itself for many, many years in its originality..."
27 February 2021,Marvel studios are finally starting to experiment and deliver quite a different take on the whole superhero wave,7.0,"I am so happy that this 2021 started with this major Marvel series. It is something fresh and for sure a different way to approach the whole superhero genre. The narrative structure is very different from the average film of this kind, in which there is the bad guy and the good guy wins. The series explains origins of Wanda Maximoff, one of the most powerful mutant on the Marvel universe. I liked the fact that episodes portrayed sitcoms through different decades, replicating perfectly the narrative structure and comedic moments typical of times. A bold move from this studio that always tried to make the most accessible productions for everyone. The result is an entertaining show that always keeps you on the verge.

Elizabeth Olsen is such a versatile actress, and she managed to match perfectly every single acting style throughout decades. She basically portrayed different characters, not easy at all. In recent years, I think that only Evan Peters pulled something similar in AHS. This require a big talent and I am very happy to see that she was finally able to show her true skills, as unfortunately she was not able to do so in the Avenger Saga. Also Paul Bettany and Kathryn Hahn, are really good. I was very happy to see Jimmy Woo and Darcy Lewis, probably two of the secondary characters that I have enjoyed the most while watching the MCU.

I really hope that Disney and Marvel will keep going down this path, as they did great with ""WandaVision"". Disney+ will release tons of new shows about superheroes and I really hope that they keep experimenting and propose new, fresh stuff. They are doing great and I hope not to be disappointed."
14 February 2021,For comic book guys only - idiot fodder.,1.0,"Unless you have a weird obsession with comic book super hero movies with a deep knowledge and understanding of DC/Marvel stuff, don't waste a minute of watching this.

I have no love for any superhero franchise output which seems to be occupying contemporary cultural consciousness and so I had no idea what this series was based on, I watched it purely as a piece of entertainment.

It's appallingly bad. The forced pastiches, the dreadful canned laughter, the crap jokes. I get it, it's supposed to be self referencing and ironic but my god, there no subtlety or inferred meaning. It's simple minded and basic.

There's no art to this. It's flat, unimaginative storytelling for people who like simple stories served up to them on a plate.

Actually, forget that, it's not even served. Wandavision is intellectual puréed junk that's packaged into simple squeezable packages for easy digestion. You know those squeezable baby food things, it's like that.

I gave it a go and managed 4 episodes. Why I bothered wasting nearly two hours of this rubbish is utterly beyond me.

Quite frankly one of the worst things I've ever seen."
17 February 2021,Amazing show,10.0,"Funny, every negative rating is from January 15th. People shouldn't even be allowed to rate an entire show after only the premiere. So ridiculous. This show is fantastic! So well written, exceptional acting, great storylines. Best show out there."
16 February 2021,It has some flaws but overall its a really good show,8.0,"I'm a big fan of the mcu world and when I heard this was given the greenlight I was overly excited beyond belief. I thought Scarlett witch/Vision were great characters to do show on because while they're widely known to die hard fans. There not as mainstream as like spiderman, ironman, and so forth.

Upon watching though I have to say show is beyond different then what I could ever expected. The first couple episodes weren't great in my opinion. They were silly and boring. But then the show starts picking up bit of traction and started to get going. It defintely has now become pretty engaging overall. One thing I diddn't love however is the lack of action. Outside of series finale there was virtually none. Also Pietro/Quicksilvers character was utterly pointless and could have been done without because he diddn't add much of dynamic to the show and only caused confusion.

I would definitely recommend this show to fans/non-fans alike. As I think theres plenty to enjoy, however I'm just not in agreement with those over top viewers that think its a ""masterpiece or ""10 out 10""."
2 October 2022,This was very....interesting...,9.0,"I can't even begin to explain this show...

I love Wanda so much and when this show came out I was so excited to watch it.

I can say, the first 1-2 episodes are kind of boring, but it pays off so much.

The story is an amazing concept, the villain, the separate storylines meeting together, it's just 💋.

If you binge this show in one night, you won't regret it. It was such a fun time and if you like science then you should definitely watch this show! And obviously, everything plays in to the mcu.

If you want to watch this, don't watch the trailer, don't do anything, just watch it. It will make you fall in love with the characters, and the whole plot in whole."
23 April 2021,Finally a good Marvel TV series,8.0,"Each episode is intriguing per se and a bit too short. I was expecting a little bit more, but still worth your time if you are a Marvel fan."
5 April 2021,Very very poor,5.0,"Expected so much better from this but it is well below par and honestly in my opinion not even worth watching. Poor story, poor acting and minimal action."
27 September 2021,This is a very smart series that is a must see and is definitely worth your time,10.0,"WandaVision (2021) is a series my wife and I recently watched on Disney+. The storyline appears to take place within a 1950/60s sitcom with a live studio audience, corney scenarios and cheesy jokes...but everything isn't as it appears. This series is created by Jac Schaeffer (Black Widow) and stars Elizabeth Olsen (Avengers: Infinity Wars), Paul Bettany (Beautiful Mind), Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah's Infinite Play List), Selena Anduze (The Haunting of Hill House) and Debra Jo Rupp (Big). The storyline for this is very unique and clever. I really liked how the characters evolved as does their display of powers, the sitcom elements and the plot. This is a very smart show that is brilliantly written and comes together well. The acting in this is out of this world and the cast was definitely challenged. The special effects were as you would expect for a Marvel show/movie. This sets up a lot of potential directions for a follow-up series and I was very impressed with how this came together in the end. Overall this is a very smart series that is a must see and is definitely worth your time, even if you're not a super hero genre fan. I would score this a 9.5/10."
2 October 2023,What an amazing show,8.0,"WandaVision, oh, what a wild, whimsical ride through the sitcom eras and the complex depths of Wanda Maximoff's mind. The acting? Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany deserve standing ovations for their mesmerizing performances that seamlessly shift between laugh-out-loud sitcom antics and heart-wrenching emotional turmoil. Film editing? A masterpiece of nostalgia and storytelling wizardry, blending decades with a finesse that's as enchanting as a sitcom theme song. Strengths? The audacity to break the Marvel mold and experiment with a genre-defying narrative that keeps you guessing until the very end. Weaknesses? If there are any, they're like Easter eggs-tiny and easily forgiven in the grand scheme. The music? A symphony of eras, each note perfectly tuned to the evolving tone of the series. The message? A poignant exploration of grief, love, and the lengths we go to rewrite our own narratives. Cinematography? Breathtaking, capturing the essence of classic TV with a modern twist. 8/10 feels almost humble for this groundbreaking series that proves superheroes can also be avant-garde storytellers."
19 January 2021,Finally I can review it as it should,8.0,"So, finally we have seen where it brought us, from a strange and confusing start we found a gem that developed slowly into quite a story. I have to admit, I didnt like it much in the start, probably because I didnt know the story at all, and with those eyes it was just strange, confusing, and over the top regarding the television techs they used (50s/60s/70s etc). Now it all makes so much sense. So I hanged in there, and from episode 4 it all started to change, the story, and my opinion.

Great acting, great storyline, great effects. Clearly a must see for superhero/sci-fi fans.

My advice? If you are like me, dont know the story and arent to familiar with these superheroes, you will probably not like it much in the start, but hang in there, it will be slowly worth it!

Now Ill enjoy the season finale, and await an hopefully equally good season 2 afterwards.

Ill leave my original comment below.

**************************************************************************************** 2 episodes and they throw 10 around as if they were on sale.

2 episodes that clearly is just a slow intro to something that may, or not be a flop or success.

Get real folks, you are killing the voting system.

I will revue it seriously after the season, based on the whole season, but so far its just a meh of a 5 that keeps med interested to see where we are heading"
6 March 2021,An innovative TV series,9.0,"WandaVision is surely a very daring Marvel show. The plot twists, the powerful dialogues and the action scenes provide us an awesome TV series. Elizabeth Olsen gives us one of her best performances and Paul Bettany manages to be up to her. Rating: 9"
28 December 2022,Scarlet witch rules 🎊,10.0,"Oh my god this is like the best marvel series ever Sooo good to watch wand's emotions take control of your mind and then even without knowing anything you will be developing a sympathy towards her.

Elizabeth olsen is the best at expressing her raw emotions ☺.

The best episode I enjoyed the most is 8th .oh the way wanda loves vision to create an entire town full of mind controlled people shows her innocent ❤ love for vision .I really want vision to be alive and want wanda to be happy. Also Agatha wasn't that bad.

In the show it was like Agatha was the main vilan but in reality she was a teacher to wanda.

She pointed out the mistakes done by wanda just like in the comics but in a vilanish way."
13 March 2021,Style over substance,6.0,"You gotta hand it to the production for maintaining such awesome and diverse art direction in this show.

Problem is, it's style over substance, and turns from something original and awkward into a pretty ordinary Avenger special effects endeavor. The writing gets lazy and sloppy as it turns into what we all have seen many, many times.

That said, it's not BAD either, if you're into this type of content."
13 January 2022,A Beautifully Crafted Masterpiece.,10.0,"""WandaVision"" has everything a Marvel fan (or any viewer in general) could ever wish for.

It is an incredibly entertaining, moving and thought-provoking series.

The only downside: it only lasted one season. I was really hoping to watch a second season, but I also understand that the narrative as a whole would have undergone significant changes and not for the better, perhaps.

Kudos to the entire Cast & Crew. 2021 has been an incredible year for me, I am so happy to have spent it in your company.

Thank you for everything from the bottom of my heart. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Chiara."
7 March 2021,"Offbeat and weird in a fresh way that the MCU needs. Keep pushing the envelope, Marvel!",7.0,
7 March 2021,Fan Expectation Will Be The Death of The MCU!!,7.0,
10 July 2022,A TV Arcadia,9.0,"Summary

What are Wanda Maximoff and Vision doing starring in a 50's sitcom?

This original and remarkable series (part of Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU) stages a brilliant narrative device recreating a perfect world, a television Arcadia haunted by disturbing cracks, configuring a dialectic that perfectly accompanies the psychological evolution of his main character.

A new type of MCU fiction that, supported by the extended tempos offered by a series, decidedly privileges the psychology of its characters and the construction of climates over the heat of battles and special effects and that can also be enjoyed by those who they don't follow the Marvel Universe and that will surely generate in them curiosity about the previous history of their characters.

Review

Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) and Vision appear as protagonists of a typical television sitcom of the 50s. Both characters (she, a sort of sorceress with certain powers and he, a kind of android, a ""synthezoid"") live in a typical suburban town as a married couple who hide their powers from their neighbors.

The series admirably reproduces the mise-en-scène of sitcoms, with a square screen and in black and white, and follows the typical dynamics of these programs (at the beginning one seems to be watching a combination of I Love Lucy and Bewitched; it also refers to other sitcoms and series like Americans, the series about the two Russian spies infiltrated in a US suburb, and Kevin can ### himself, which also takes place as a sitcom)

WandaVision is another series (like The Baby) that shows its cards as the chapters go by. Obviously, the viewer suspects that there is a cat locked up, wondering what two Marvel Avengers (especially one of them) are doing in that situation, and the suspicion is confirmed when disturbing anomalies appear in the story. This duality constitutes the essence of the narrative device that the series puts on stage and that has the virtue of not exhausting itself in novelty since it is ""updated"" as the chapters go by, basically responding to the evolution of Wanda's character. However, this evolution towards the inevitable synthesis of that dialectic, where its contours are being lost (necessary and functional loss to that evolution), leads the series at times to more conventional tracks (and related to the Marvel universe style) and less interesting than they make her decline. Little more can be revealed about a plot that adds layers of content, meaning and formality, to its initial impressions.

The sitcom humor and sentimentality of the series (sometimes effective and others deliberately faked and out of date) are interrupted by the irruption of those changes of tone that are very intriguing and disturbing, ranging from strangeness to the sinister, in the cabal meaning of the latter term. I clarify that I have not yet seen the films of the Marvel Universe in which both characters appear, but I consider that the series can be seen the same (although it does spoil previous episodes of its protagonists in the films). Surely for fans of the MCU, the series works as a sequel or spin off (and as an introduction to other characters and sagas) and poses more questions (and answers) than the ""virgin"" viewer.

Showrunner Jac Schaeffer's series creatively stages the way trauma is sought to be overcome, illustrating all its phases, with these anomalies making their way into that television Arcadia, a happy and perfect world that recreates the perfection of the aesthetics and the tone of various television styles and that only on a few occasions falls into parody as a means and not as an end.

Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are perfect in the leading roles, as well as Kathryn Hahn as the typical nosy neighbor, in a Marvel fiction that, supported by the extended tempos offered by a series, decidedly favors the psychology of its characters and the construction of climates above the heat of battle and special effects."
16 January 2021,Unfocused Garbage,,Maybe it's not fair to judge something so early but what I've seen so far is absolute garbage. It's unfocused uneven and completely lacking in charm. They've managed to take the established chemistry we've seen before from these great characters and ruin it. It's like they actually have no chemistry on screen. Everything that unfolded plays as boring and uninteresting. I expected way way better from Marvel's first Disney plus effort. Here's hoping it gets better.
16 January 2021,"Cute, classic, and clever!",8.0,"A fun show! They capture the essence of TV (as some of us remember it), from back in the 50's (us older folk, that is). Very well made, imho! Quite enjoyable!"
19 March 2021,Marvel's not afraid to explore new territories.,9.0,
11 February 2021,Why are people rating this already,8.0,"There's still 4 episodes to go, so I don't know how people come to a conclusion already. But don't get me wrong, the show is great"
16 January 2021,Overhyped by bots,1.0,"It's pure trash and boring, a show about the MCU characters nobody cares about was already looking bad in the trailers, but now it's confirmed. It's a massive waste of time."
30 January 2021,Never ever underestimate MARVEL!!,10.0,"Oh boy, Oh boy, I thought endgame is the official end to the marvel universe but don't you ever stop believing in kevin fiege and co. They will amaze you as hell. WandaVision is something i never imagined, i had no expectations at first and then after 2 episodes i wasn't intrigued enough but episdoe 4 blowed my mind. Stop believing in the pseudo reviews by DCverse and watch wandavision. Something historical is on the way."
16 February 2021,Please ignore every bad review before 4th episode,10.0,It's amazing. It is one of the best show that marvel can build it's amazing. This show is about things that happening after thanos just watch it
6 March 2021,"Great fun, but I have a question",8.0,
6 September 2021,"Marvel plays you, and you will love it.",10.0,
20 March 2021,Not worth your time,6.0,"Completely unnecessary first three episodes that really sour the whole experience. And then? A good material that would have been a great study in sorrow and could have worked great as a short movie; but it is Marvel, so instead, they made it into this meandering, overblown mess that ultimately destroys its own message with idiotic final act. Because if there were just honest emotions instead of pointless CGI fights, the audience wouldnt enjoy it, I guess. Shallow, mediocre. A missed opportunity."
5 March 2021,Solid marvel show with a star turn from Elizabeth Olsen,8.0,"Wanda and Vision live as a US sit-com family.

I enjoyed most of the series, particularly for the premise and overall idea of the show, plus I think Elizabeth Olsen has a star quality that makes her quite watchable.

The overarching narrative is a fairly slow burner and it succeeds in creating and developing great intrigue before certain episodes throw exposition at you. Personally, I found the earlier part of the series more interesting as it holds all the mystery and allows you to theorise about what is going on. Its main themes about control and coping with grief and trauma are nicely played out as the things become clearer towards the end.

There is a nice offbeat style to it, particularly as episodes unfold like a genuine sit-com and little weird moments indicating all is not right. This involves a lot of changes in tone and character from the actors and it works very well. It also has a nice self-referential humour that keeps things entertaining.

Unfortunately, there were creative decisions made with some characters that did not work for me. One antagonist who is revealed towards the latter part of the show adds no substance and the amount of visual spectacle at key moments I personally find distracts from the plot and results in an anticlimax. Also, it felt to me that, similar to some parts of The Mandalorian, there are contrivances around characters that are purely there as lead-ins for other shows.

All that being said, all that spectacle is very well done as you would expect from Marvel and everything looks incredibly good.

Most performances are great, with Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and Tayonah Parris being particularly good. It is without a doubt Olsen's show, as she charismatically switches from comedy to drama in the blink of an eye and has an incredibly striking screen presence.

My favourite episodes were 'Don't Touch That Dial' which has some of the best humour and 'The All-New Halloween Spooktacular!' which answers some of the plot's questions in an entertaining way.

For me it's a 7.5/10 but I round upwards."
5 February 2021,10 stars is not enough!!!,10.0,
27 January 2021,Not cliché,10.0,
26 July 2021,It's DIFFERENT,7.0,"And a good different, of course. Even by MARVEL's standard, this is so new of an experiment.

Not sure if I've grown old or dried my share of unbelievable-fiction to enjoy and be fascinated by it anymore.

A little underwhelming experience at the end though. Nonetheless, it's a well made movie. Successfully does what it intends to (it seems). Question being if it is for you or not.

But the Black Mirror direction MARVEL is talking, I'm quite uncertain if I could hit the road with it."
11 March 2021,To make a female led superhero show work,8.0,"Let's face folks, most of female led superhero movies and TV shows suffer from: poor writing, badly designed characters and inflated rotten tomatoes score. In Wanda Vision we see the contrast, the writing here is great, the characters are well developed and the mysteries are gripping. I, unlike many, didn't hate the ending, it mostly made sense to me. To all the people who were put off by the sit com look: trust me, induring the first two episodes and getting to the third is imminsely rewarding. Highly recommend"
10 July 2021,Wasted potential,7.0,"This show is frustrating to me. It could and should've been one of the best MCU products but it failed because it had to follow that generic mcu formula in the end.

This show has some absolutely fantastic and mind-blowing moments. The performances are great and leave little to be desired. The reason this show annoys me so much is because as this show went on, it set itself up as something totally different than all of the other MCU films. It really kept that up until the finale, which was hugely disappointing. The finale was just incredibly generic and ruined all the beautiful moments this show had prior to it. As a result the showI unfortunately just downgraded itself to another generic mcu product. Now if it had set itself up as a generic mcu product, I wouldn't have been disappointed but it did and failed."
18 May 2021,Just couldn't watch it,1.0,After 6 episodes I gave up. Garbage. Boring and weird. The old sitcom thing gets so annoying.
15 January 2021,The trailer was cool but the first couple of episodes are not my cup of tea.,1.0,No thanks. I'll wait until the rest of the episodes have released because the trailer *did* look interesting.
2 March 2021,"Good If You Are a Marvel or TV History Fan, Great If You're Both!",9.0,"The trouble that WandaVision has, at the start, is that most 20something MCU fans aren't familiar with the sitcoms it mimics. There are clear nods to ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" ""Bewitched,"" ""The Brady Bunch,"" ""Who's The Boss?"" and ""Family Ties"" among a collection of references throughout this limited run series. But what Gen Z people ever sat through those programs? ""The Office?"" Well, okay, maybe that one.

Likewise, they toss in commercials that reference elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that would be missed by people unfamiliar with that aspect.

The fact is, you will grok the program if you are in either one of those ""camps"" (pun intended) but you'll truly love it if you somehow are in both.

Even more importantly, at the moment of its initial run, WandaVision served as a kind of metaphor for our collective lives.

Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen, not Montgomery) trying to surround herself with the things that make her comfortable is doing everything she can to protect her love, Vision (Paul Bettany) and their family and home. This gets accomplished through the standard Jump The Shark (can I still use that phrase?) tropes - wacky neighbor (Kathryn Hahn's Agnes) , pets and kids (Sparky, plus Julian Hilliard's Billy and Jett Klyne's Tommy), characters abuptly removed (Teyonah Parris' Geraldine) and even ""Same Character, Different Actor"" (Evan Peters' Pietro). But as soon as you think you're in complete control, you find out maybe you aren't.

Wanda's attempt to make things seem happy, normal and fun, despite the outside world infringing on and even frightening the main characters, speaks directly to the collective circumstances the world was experiencing as the COVID-19 pandemic continued, in a way that none of the creatives could have envisioned when the project was being designed.

WandaVision, in that sense, takes a very unique place in Television History both reflecting our lives and helping us escape them. The brilliance of everyone in the cast is made better by the fact that everything that happens in the narrative, needs to happen. The logic is flawless and the story told in that sitcom style fits like a jigsaw puzzle piece.

I'm not sure any Marvel fans will seek out episodes of sitcoms from a half century ago based on this, but it's an excellent way to indoctrinate their parents to the MCU!"
25 July 2021,Worth the Watch; But Don't Overhype Yourselves,8.0,"WandaVision was such an amazing show to watch from beginning to end. This is also a good start to the new phase in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

WIthout context or knowing what the show was about, each episode raises questions as to how Wanda and Vision are inside this TV sitcom world. Not knowing what was going on brought out so many chilling mystery vibes to the story,

Wanda & Vision's romantic relationship is heavily explored and continues from Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War.

One important reminder to note is about forming theories in this show. Early viewers formulated a lot of theories that don't end up coming true at the end of the show. For instances, some characters the show thinks they're hinting appearances for don't actually show up at all.

So reminder, don't get your hopes up and don't have any high expectations for crazy superhero suprises."
15 January 2021,This was painful to watch. I had to force myself to finish the second episode.,5.0,"Firstly, I should say that I like the MCU movies, but Scarlet Witch and Vision were never my favourite characters. I'm mainly disappointed because all the early reviews I saw were pretty glowing. I wasn't actually planning on watching the series until I read those pre-release reviews (which were based on the first 4 episodes I believe). Now I'm wondering if something happened in episodes 3 and 4 to redeem the show, or the critics were just being Marvel sheeple.

The first two episodes were painful to watch. I chuckled once or twice but the majority of the time I was cringing big-time. It's like an old 50s sitcom with laugh track every few seconds and hardly anything is funny. The main characters act ridiculously silly all the time. They're completely not who we've seen them as in the movies. They have their powers, but that's the only connection; their personalities are completely different.

Sure I've only watched two episodes, but plenty of other good shows have had me hooked by episode 2. I shouldn't have to commit to a whole season to see if your show is good or not. This one, at least at this point, is definitely not."
28 February 2021,Pulls You Back Into the MCU,10.0,"I can't speak for everybody, but after ""Endgame"" I was exhausted. From 2008-19 I watched as this climax was slowly built. When the arc was finally complete, I thought I had had my fill.

But then this show came along, with a weird and ambitious story. More self-contained (literally, there's a force field involved) than other Marvel products, it deals more seriously with the personal life of the hero. Wanda, who has dealt with such trauma in her life, gives us a heartbreaking portrayal of how great power and great grief can manifest.

Every episode pushes you to watch the show from a new perspective. I have never witnessed something quite like it, and I would recommend it to anyone who has lost their heart for Marvel content, or cannot wait to see more."
5 April 2022,You should watch it.,8.0,"As much as I would have liked to watch it in one go I'm glad they released one episode each week. People ecpected too much after endgame. The show was good, it gave us Scarlet Witch finally. People should stop complaining about the plot."
24 May 2021,DIsney pays for most of the good reviews,1.0,What a waste of a show that had so much potential. Why waste it with awful world building for 2 episodes that become meaningless. What a horrid show of nothingness. Marvel will be on its last legs soon.
15 January 2021,Something interesting better happen fast.,6.0,"Two episodes in, and it's actually done well if you like old school sitcoms, but despite the decent writing, the teasers for what's to come are too little to keep me interested much longer. I don't have 22 minutes to waste just to get 30 seconds of plot every episode.

Six out of ten stars right now but it's going to loose a star every episode if something interesting doesn't happen fast."
5 March 2021,Based on comic storyline,9.0,"Watching this serie takes me back to reading the old marvel/dc comics. The story lines is very similar to the enchanted village stories with the REVEAL of the main villain and the TWIST where the Hero fools the antagonist, the estetics is spot on. So i think a lot of work was put in to make this right. Especially in the first episodes where they go black and white 50-s to 60-70 to modern sitcom feel. I think they nailed it. The acting story music vfx is very suitable based on the time period (there are some few exeptions that kerps it from beeing a 10). Well Done Disney."

23 January 2021,"Marvel Studios has taken a big risk with this show, & it's definitely paying off!",9.0,"WandaVision focuses on the adventures of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen) & Vision(Paul Bettany), after the events of Avengers: Infinity War(2018) & Avengers: Endgame(2019). Wanda & Vision are living the perfect, idyllic suburban life. However, something is amiss & not everything is as it seems.

WandaVision is an amazing show. Creator Jac Schaeffer, director Matt Shakman & Marvel head Kevin Feige, have kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Disney+ era, with the most unique, wacky & wonderful show, I've ever seen. One flaw with the episodic format of WandaVision is that, the action set pieces three episodes in, are virtually non-existent. Marvel Cinematic Universe adjacent shows like Daredevil(2015-2018), Jessica Jones(2015-2019), Luke Cage(2016-2018), Iron Fist(2017-2018), The Defenders(2017), The Punisher(2017-2019) & Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.(2013-2020) have action set pieces galore. I understand that they are paying homage to the classic sitcom era but, even one or two action set pieces in the first three episodes, would have made me happy. The highlight of the show is the suspense element, which keeps the viewer guessing as to why everything that's happening, is happening. Elizabeth Olsen is spectacular as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. Olsen portrays a myriad of expressions as her complex character, with ease & aplomb. Paul Bettany is outstanding as Vision. Bettany has given us a completely new take on Vision & I love it. Elizabeth Olsen & Paul Bettany share this adorable chemistry in all their scenes together. Kathryn Hahn is fantastic as Agnes. Teyonah Parris is brilliant as Geraldine. The supporting cast is great. WandaVision is worth a watch for all Marvel Cinematic Universe super fans. It's definitely getting better & better with each episode. However, don't start watching with sky high expectations."

PLEASE !!,9.0,"This show does not start at the first two episodes really... you may be messed up but don't give up, it's perfect writing, coming from someone who is not a fan of the fast food movies Marvel used to bring... but their series are different. And it show why here... it's during episode 4 that I was really wowwww! And like a Christopher Nolan film, you are in a puzzle... and i'm talking to you seeing only 6 episodes. there's 3 to come and I will take my time and enjoy every minute of it !"

It isn't what people would expect from them."
24 March 2021,STARTED OFF REALLY STRONG...,7.0,"WandaVision started off really strong in the beginning. I loved the mystery aspects of the show and the vibe that something is really off was intriguing and interesting to me. Got me hooked! Unfortunately it ended up being lackluster after episode 7 imo and all the teasing and references throughout, were just that. The show still ended up being good nonetheless just not as clever as i thought it was."
16 February 2021,Marvel on fire 🔥,10.0,"For anyone giving this show bad reviews, give it 2 episodes. The show is genius! It's goes places and takes chances no other show has. I'm obsessed with it. Marvel has taken a huge leap in creativity here"

18 January 2021,I don't get it; am I missing something? (2 episodes in),6.0,"As I write this, only the first two episodes have been released. However, I do not know if I will watch another episode. The first two episodes were boring and appear pointless. If you did not already know who Vision and the Scarlet Witch are, you would not be watching this show. So, there is no point to any long setup about them.

While I felt nostalgia when seeing Kitty Forman from that 70s show in the roll of a pre-70s housewife, none of it was funny and I could care less if I ever see her character again. The same is true of all of the supporting characters that they introduced.

I have seen reviews suggesting that there is a deeper meaning, that I should pay more attention, and that I should wait, but the problem is that I just don't care anymo . . ."
20 March 2021,Really only good for Marvel fans,6.0,"I love the idea behind the show...it's intriguing and exciting and mysterious....however after watching it and then having a read of the trivia, I realised there were many references I have not picked up as I haven't seen any of the Marvel movies. I thought maybe this show might stand alone on its own and be easy enough to follow for people who have not seen the films but there's just too much background information to fully get the whole story. And I liked it, but for me personally, it would have been better if it firstly was not Marvel; that it was a standalone limited series, and secondly if it was a little longer. Fantastic acting from the cast though, especially Elizabeth Olsen."
8 September 2021,This signature is another marvel master piece,9.0,"Wow wow wow,look you I'll need lots of patients seeing this series👉👀👈,if not you will be wasting on it.gradually as you progress through they begin to unravel the mystery behind Wanda nd vision😘😘😘."
14 May 2021,Mixed feelings,6.0,"I think WandaVision is a show that was at its best when there was a sense of mystery and intrigue- namely, the first few episodes.

Getting some answers at first was fun - around episodes 3-5 from memory), and I was enjoying the interplay of storylines inside and outside of the town. Also, the sitcom decade by decade gimmick was clever at times and a lot of fun... but it really lost me in the last couple of episodes, when it returns to more familiar MCU ground.

Some of the writing got extra clunky, acting wasn't great (Olsen and Hahn were both really good until the last two episodes, when their performances suddenly seemed to get a lot more wooden and awkward), and it more or less climaxes with a big action set piece that just doesn't deliver the same way a standard but fun climax in one of the MCU movies might look.

So kind of disappointing, but I find shows nowadays often hook me for a few episodes with an initially great premise, then kind of lose me within a season or so (lookin' at you, Westworld). But the fact I did enjoy a good part of WandaVision means that at least I don't feel it was a waste of time.

Can recommend quite easily for anyone who's been missing the MCU since 2019, but just don't expect too much..."
29 September 2021,Each episode of the story unfolds more and gets even more interesting.,9.0,"Cant Stop Watching!

If you are a fan of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) then chances are you will want to watch the WandaVision.

After the shocking events of Avengers Endgame, now we get to focus of Wanda Maximoff and her way of coping with what happened.

The show is formatted like old sitcoms throughout the decades like the Dik Van Dyke Show as well as Modern family. We see Wanda and Vision in a simple suburban life, different than anything we've ever seen from Marvel before. But of course, everything is not what it seems and the show takes on several plot twists and surprises. (I won't spoil anything specific).

Elizabeth olsen and Paul Bettany are wonderful at giving us a show that keeps us on our toes.

I won't lie to you, the show is insane and you will definitely have a lot of questions. But each episode the story unfolds more and gets even more interesting. Every week I hear new theories about what is to come and can't wait for the next episodes.

(I would recommend watching the prior marvel movies before watching WandaVision)"
11 July 2023,Nice one!,8.0,"WnadaVision is very interesting and different from everything Marvel has done so far, at least half of the series. The first 4-5 episodes are absolutely brilliant, you don't even realize that it's part of the MCU but slowly until the end it becomes more and more a typical Marvel CGI fest which is not really that bad but considering the originality with which it started the series, I would have liked to keep this until the end. Nevertheless, it's a good series, it has a different and mysterious atmosphere, which is always a plus point for me, even if the twists were a bit obvious, they were still satisfying, but again, it would have a greater impact if it ended the way it started."
28 February 2022,Again I have been surprised,9.0,"I really expected less from this show, that's why I even delayed to watch it. Well the first episodes may not be interesting at first but trust me you will enjoy it. Marvel has surprised me again.

That's why I always expect less and get much in return."
12 November 2022,Very good and creative,8.0,"WandaVison is a show that basically explains what happened to Wanda post-endgame. The show is unique and breaks the monotony of Marvel by making the show appear like a sitcom. It also achieved being perfectly eerie while keeping its comedic character.

This show is definitely worth a watch beacuse of two reasons. First of all it introduces new characters and is important to the Multiverse Saga lore, second its an enjoyable and well put show. The last thing I want to mention is that it was pretty bold to resurrect vision.

Overall it was a pretty good show with little to none cons, I definitely recommend it."

It was painful to watch regardless of being the first episode and I switched off long before the credits.Nope it's definitely Not for me and Hugely Disappointing.Marvel This was a Mistake on an epic Scale.Where is there some paint Drying I can watch as I'm sure it's more entertaining than this!!! 1/10 is generous.

However, the final three episodes were at best ""confusing"" and hard to understand. I kept getting lost and found myself dozing through episodes 7 to 9 even though there were the most important episodes. Also, the fact that WandaVision is like a prequel for Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness is really perplexing.

Other than that it was really good. Kudos to the MCU. Long may it reign."

22 January 2021,I wanted to like it,1.0,"I really wanted to like it. Elizabeth Olsen is a beautiful woman no matter if she is taped in black & white or full color. Backdrop sets are nice, reminiscence of the Dick Van Dyke, I love Lucy and Bewitch sets. But I really really really hated the script. Where was the comedy? Yeah yeah, they are super heroes in a 1950-60 tv show. But for how long can you drag along before it gets boring. Even the real tv shows of back then had better jokes than this spoof. This show lacks charm. And the artificial laugh track in the background just made it more cringely watching this. I am basing my review based on the only two available episodes. Disney hasn't released additional episodes as of this writing.

So bad, I really think Elizabeth Olsen could be the new Elizabeth Montgomery. Both are/were beautiful women."

24 July 2022,A new direction in Marvel,8.0,"Marvel's advertising campaigns are always ready to please their viewers with preliminary content. There are a lot of videos and various materials coming out before each new studio project. However, the announcement and subsequent marketing of the series ""Wanda/Vision"" became a kind of discovery for moviegoers. It was a new direction in the franchise familiar to fans.

To begin with, it was necessary to accept that the project would become a mini-series, the first of many subsequent ones, but it was the first. Then the format of the work was alarming. We are offered something out of genre, when some scenery and incarnations of heroes are replaced by others, showing different eras. What do. I was personally preparing for something special.

The series started, and each new episode initially raised more questions. What happens, where does it happen, when does it happen? Somewhere after the equator of the project, puzzles suddenly begin to take shape, a dynamic and interesting project emerges. Of course, the series does not reach the individual blockbuster films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it is good in its own way.

The visual component, the design of the scenes, the styles - all this looks great. The creators perfectly managed to immerse their viewers in different epochs of the last century, told through an excellent visual series what the sitcoms of the past were, because the current generations could hardly watch American TV series of such distant years now.

In addition, we are shown the evolution of the main character Wanda, who finds development in this particular arch, faces her demons, confronts the villain. Elizabeth Olsen fully reveals her character to us and does it very cool. Wanda tries on new images from series to series: a young wife, mother, defender of her new world. I think that the project as a whole revealed the potential of the actress and gave food for thought. After all, the development of the Wanda Arch is still ahead. And it promises to be very interesting.

The series came out decent. This is an unusual and new work, both from a genre point of view and from the point of view of the format. Small series that add up to a massive overall picture and tell the audience a full-fledged story.

This project is clearly for connoisseurs of the Marvel universe. It should be watched in the same order as the films were released, otherwise there is a risk of not understanding a lot. There are already famous heroes in the project, and new ones will be presented. One thing cannot be taken away - the project is really important for the development of the Cinematic Universe.

8 out of 10."
25 November 2022,"Fascinating, captivating, incredible",9.0,"Wandavision is a unique entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has arguably carved out its own sub-genre within superhero films, but with that has come a series of oft-repeated story beats which can cause some of these movies and shows to feel stale.

Wandavision is a breath of fresh. It presents a unique, engaging mystery, and respects its premise enough to drip-feed details in a way that makes you say ""just one more episode"" until it's all over. Wanda's journey is one of the most incredible and mature that I think we've ever seen in the superhero genre, bolstered by Elizabeth Olsen's landmark performance. The rest of the cast is equally commendable, with special mention going to Paul Bettany and Kathryn Hahn.

This is such a unique show, that whether you're a fan of the MCU or just Wanda, this is a must-watch. The cast and crew have made something very, very special here, and it immediately sets the bar for future episodic content."
7 March 2021,A swing and a miss,4.0,"Two first episodes are there predicated on enthusiasm of marvel fans and the weight that two of their hottest properties have, it might work for some solely because wanda and vision are played by their original actors but it's a good example of theme over substance."
25 November 2021,Did not expect that!,9.0,"Simply put, I did not expect to be this good. It's really good.

15 January 2021,What's up with those ratings?,,
10 January 2022,Magic!!,9.0,"This show brilliantly displays the grief and trauma of Wanda and thoroughly explains her history in an empathetic way which has caused me to cry many times. The different elements of the era are very creative and I believe that shows the love Wanda has for vision, want to be with him for a long time, so these different eras make her wish sort of come true, and I find that very sad and beautiful. This show brings out your curiosity from day 1 and it's amazingly written. This domestic vibe from the show is different from any other marvel movie or series are written, which I find perfect for wandavision, it's wholesome and makes you feel a lot closer to the characters. The acting from both Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany is outstanding, not to mention Teyonah Parris' performance as well as Kathryn Hahn's amazing portrayal of the villain. The addition to the cast, bringing back Darcy Lewis and Johnny woo, is amazing. I also loved those adorable small new superheros Billy and Tommy. This show was such an emotional rollercoaster and all the actors, especially Elizabeth Olsen, are so talented and are a big part in creating this masterpiece."

10 July 2021,I'd recommend it,8.0,"Not bad at all. It is kind of weird, but in no way that weirdness makes it bad. The first several episodes are difficult ot wrap your head around. It is definitely one of a kind. I really enojoy it, with one exception - Kat's character. She's a good actress, but playing ""a hacker"" is beyond unbelievable, as she mentions in one of the episodes that she will ""hack into"" and the keybord tappings are so lame, it's like a movie from the early 2000s. It's not some majer issue, I just find it irritating. Other than that, a great show you might regret missing."
6 March 2021,"WandaVision is a fascinating story about grief, making it some of the best MCU content. Elizabeth Olsen and Wanda prove they're the strongest members of the Avengers.",9.0,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

Original Review (based on the season's first three episodes handed to press)

Marvel delivered an unprecedentedly successful superhero universe that culminated in the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame (Spider-Man: Far from Home is actually the last movie of the Infinity Saga, but let's ignore that). With the first overarching story ending after twenty-three films, the MCU now begins a new Era. Basically, Phase Four is truly another Phase One, where viewers will meet new heroes to root for. However, there are dozens of Avengers still in the game, including the astonishingly powerful Wanda.

Television will play a massive role in the upcoming saga, with miniseries starring key superheroes having a significant impact in the movies. Obviously, this raises the question: do viewers need to watch the TV shows in order to understand and follow the films? I believe so. Some series might not have as much impact as others, but WandaVision will undoubtedly affect Wanda's path in the MCU. From being one of the most powerful Avengers to the possibility of Wanda being the next big villain, this character has limitless potential. In addition to this, Elizabeth Olsen is arguably one of the best actresses in the franchise, and honestly, of her entire generation.

Therefore, even though I always try to keep my expectations as moderate as possible, I couldn't help but feel extremely hyped for WandaVision. The series is as weird and mysterious as I expected it to be. In the first three episodes, the viewer is placed inside a black-and-white sitcom, where it becomes super clear that everything that's happening is occurring inside Wanda's own reality or something similar that she's definitely responsible for. Having in mind what happened to Vision in his last movie, it seems that this series will heavily deal with sensitive matters, such as grief, depression, and unhealthy escapism. However, these first episodes are pretty much set in following the comedy route.

Boasting tons of references to the respective period of classic television, WandaVision is much more hilarious than I ever anticipated it to be. Several seemingly easy yet efficient jokes about Wanda and Vision's powers and their nature are the ones that bring out the most generous laughter (impeccable writing from Jac Schaeffer). In this regard, I have to praise Kathryn Hahn (Agnes), whose performance as the ""nosy neighbor"" is wonderfully funny. Teyonah Parris doesn't really interpret her real character yet (Monica Rambeau), but her display is rather interesting. The rest of the cast is pretty good, but it all comes down to Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, who are beautifully charming and amusing together.

Their chemistry is even more palpable now that they're the protagonists of their own story. It's a strange feeling watching Bettany portray Vision again, but his terrific performance comes to demonstrate that the viewer's connection with the character is as humanly compelling as any other. However, Olsen is the real star of the show. I admit that I might be a bit biased since she is one of my favorite actresses working today, but Olsen proves why she's worthy of bigger roles in Hollywood outside of the MCU. An unbelievable emotional range, excellent comedic timing, exquisite expressiveness, and an impressive capability of drastically and quickly changing styles. An Emmy nomination wouldn't be surprising.

The main storyline revolves around Wanda's apparently ideal life with Vision. How? That is the intriguing mystery, which exponentially receives more clues after each episode. A certain symbol points to an organization that will undoubtedly make Marvel fans scream with excitement, right from the very first episode (if you look closely, you'll find it). This is the first MCU content since July 2019, so the stakes are inevitably high as Matt Shakman must fulfill the mission of bringing back the enthusiasm for the respective universe. Shakman and Schaeffer employ weirdness and unconventional storytelling that transform the series into an extremely captivating story, even though the main answer for what's happening seems quite clear.

Technically, Christophe Beck's score is the standout. From the timely sound effects of classic television to specific songs that play during certain moments, Beck delivers a score that elevates the overall show. The opening credits are unique and always different, referencing various Eras of television (shoutout to Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez for composing the theme music). As for the rest, terrific editing from Tim Roche, Nona Khodai, and Zene Baker. The visual effects look seamless even in black-and-white, and Jess Hall's cinematography cleverly resembles sitcoms attributes. Outstanding production design (Mark Worthington) as well.

All in all, after only three episodes, WandaVision proves to be as weird, mysterious, and exceptionally captivating as it intends to be. Matt Shakman and Jac Schaeffer deliver a surprisingly hilarious show with just the right amount of hints to what's truly happening. Even though the global answer seems rather predictable, creative storytelling builds an atmosphere of uncertainty and puzzling doubts that will leave viewers craving for the next episode. From the gorgeous black-and-white to Christophe Beck's brilliant score, Wanda and Vision's apparently ideal life is surrounded by technical attributes that pay homage to the Era of classic television. Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are all fantastic, but Elizabeth Olsen is the indisputable star, showing her undeniable acting talent that might very well earn her an Emmy nod. As the first MCU content in more than a year, WandaVision conquered my full attention for the remaining episodes, which surely hold impactful revelations. It's still unclear the real influence it will have in the films' realm, but I can only assume it's significant. Do not miss it!

Post-Finale Review (based on the remaining episodes and the entire season)

The following six episodes couldn't be better. The decade-spanning homage to sitcoms continues, but it exponentially decreases its attempts at humor and silly slapstick. As expected, a much more dramatic, emotional storyline takes hold of the narrative, each episode coming closer to give the viewers answers to the dozens of questions raised by the previous episodes. A few more puzzles arise with the introduction/revelation of characters who will definitely leave the audience incredibly excited, but it's the focus on Wanda's feelings that ultimately elevates this miniseries to some of the best content in the genre of superheroes.

The study of Wanda's grief and what she did to deal with the loss of the ones she loved the most is by far the most mysteriously fascinating aspect of the entire show. Even though most of Wanda's actions seem quite predictable from the get-go - especially in a non-detailed perspective - the storytelling choices and paths that Matt Shakman and the team of screenwriters come up with are quite imaginative. Every single viewer will remember a specific sentence forever since it's so powerful that it can even work as a healing mechanism to many people going through pain similar to Wanda's. Brilliant writing, from the pilot to the finale.

One massive advantage of one-season series is their immunity to ridiculously illogical, absurd fan theories and social media pressure, simply because it's already finished before the first episodes airs, so there's no way of the show getting influenced by the public's opinion. It's fun to theorize with friends and attempt to figure out what's truly happening, but when it reaches the levels of excessive fanboyism, it becomes dangerously annoying and hurtful to fans themselves. People create the most ludicrous theories surrounding characters and storylines based on incredibly ambiguous and subjective ""clues"" that are far from being remotely significant. Consequently, irrealistic expectations lead many of these fans to an impending letdown once the finale comes around.

Fortunately, I stayed sane and kept my expectations grounded, waiting patiently for the show to amaze me. The finale is a near-perfect ending to an utterly impressive series that will impact the future of the upcoming MCU series. Many viewers - mainly hardcore fans - will find it disappointing due to the inevitable dismissal of hyped theories, but overall, WandaVision will end up as a positive experience for a significant majority. I really only have minor issues with a particular episode where the overwhelming fan-service risks the logic of its presence, Josh Stamberg's annoyingly cliche character, and a certain outcome left a bit too vague for the series finale.

WandaVision is truly some of the best content ever seen in the genre of superheroes. From the mysteriously unconventional storytelling that never ceased to be incredibly captivating to the beautiful homage to decade-defining sitcoms, Jac Schaeffer and Matt Shakman approach grief and the different ways people handle it in an undoubtedly impactful manner. Despite the main narrative following a predictable path, the theory-inducing side stories and secondary characters throw the audience in loops of constant doubt, ultimately generating a surreal amount of hype for the next episode. The series never loses focus of its emotional core, which is connected to one of the greatest pros of one-season shows: these can't be influenced by absurd fan theories and online pressure. Both Elizabeth Olsen and Wanda prove they're part of the strongest members of the MCU, with the actress delivering an Emmy-worthy performance (shockingly outstanding range) and the character showing her true power prompted by her solitude and persevering love. Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are magnificent as well, but in the end, it was Wanda's show all along.

Rating: A"
12 February 2021,Don't speak to soon,10.0,"Just reading through some early reviews Well just goes to show if you have faith and wait a little while you get the show you want from Disney/Marvel after all

Really great use of aged platforms to organically grow a story"
13 April 2023,"Phase four of the MCU opens with an intriguing mash-up of Pleasantville, The Prisoner, and character study with solid performances by Olsen and Bettany",8.0,"Avengers Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live as husband and wife in a sitcom format that changes decades and styles ever so often while dealing with minor conflicts that resolve at the end of a half-hour. However overtime cracks begin to form in the veneer making of this happy-go-lucky façade.

Wandavision is the first Marvel Studios series created for Disney+ as well as the first MCU television project to have direct ties to the mainline features after prior projects like Agents of SHIELD and various Netflix Defenders shows were mostly self-contained having little impact on the feature films and existing parallel to them. The series began development in 2018 as part of a directive to create several shortform streaming projects for Disney+ bearing the Marvel branding centered on characters in the MCU that had not fronted their own standalone projects. The idea of Wanda and Vision living in ""Suburban bliss"" was initiated by Marvel President Kevin Feige who wanted to use the series to explore the characters of Wanda and Vision as well as their relationship. Jac Shaeffer who was working on the long gestating Black Widow movie heard of the series and it's premise and excited by the prospects had a pitch meeting for her ideas leading to her hired as head writer. Upon release the series received near universal acclaim and became the most watched series premiere of a Disney+ series displacing previous record holder season two of The Mandalorian. The series definitely made an impression with viewers and is definitely worthy of praise.

The show does a good job of deconstructing and homaging sitcoms while also laying the groundwork for the mystery as to what is behind this world. While I can't reveal too much about the plot as it's one of those shows that's best experienced for yourself, I can say that beneath the sitcom antics that homage many staples tied to the decades from Ozzie and Harriet to Malcolm in the Middle, there's a unique commentary on the welcome artificiality of sitcoms and their service as a means of escape and distraction from the real world. The show does a great job of elaborating on the characters of both Wanda and Vision including exploring many elements of the characters that were overlooked in their introduction (such as in Age of Ultron) and while the show's peeling away at the veneer does lead to some very familiar MCU action beats, they're not bad even if the journey to them was more engaging than the ultimate destination.

I liked WandaVision for being a unique approach to the MCU and a solid character study of Wanda and Vision that really took advantage of Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany as performers. The show also featured some solid appearances in the supporting cast (including a supporting Thor cast member who was way better here than in those films) and while the reveal of the proverbial ""man behind the curtain"" isn't as good as what came before this is a solid miniseries in its own right."

The story is about Wanda after the Infinity Saga, you can say this as a PTSD saga I guess... cannot go much into the plot as it got a lot of surprises. The series starts off slow as the episode goes on the plot thickens, I have to say please don't scratch it off after watching 2/3 episodes as I can assure you from the 4th episode it's a bang. This is not like the Defenders characters kinda show it actually sticks to the MCU movies formula. Got really great characters, it got a really good premise, a banger in the middle, and a good finale.

The directing was just brilliant, it was experimental, weird, and very colorful. The acting was top-notch from every character shout-out to Olsen, Bettany, and Kathryn Hahn, got really great supporting cast. The comedy was phenomenal was delivered well, the dialogues were sometimes cliche, and the costumes were just too good. Really a great start to Phase 4, can't wait to see what happens next."
17 April 2021,Seeing my childhood on screen,9.0,I had such nostalgic feelings though-out this show. It was such a clever unique way to provide this new emotion to watchers on a tv show!!!! Absolute Genius! I loved every second of it and the short bursts of episodes! Round of applause all around!
5 March 2021,MOST DARK Project of MCU Till Now.,10.0,"Honestly Speaking, I didn't have much expectation from this show. But now it becomes one of my favourite things from MCU. In first some episodes many negative reviews were there but after episode 3 it completely grabbed everyone.

I was not liking the character of Agnes till episode 7, but after episode 8 she became the best character of the show. Yes, last episode may disappoint many but these 9 episodes were like something I didn't want to be finished. In my opinion, it's the most romantic, emotional yet The Most DARK project of MCU till now.

Now Have To Wait For Multiverse of Madness.

You Can watch The Series On Disney+ Hotstar Premium. India

16 February 2021,I am one of the few people who had no doubts from episode 1!,9.0,"Marvel really upped their game here. This show is so well thought out, it's truly mesmerizing. It leaves you wanting more everytime the credits start rolling. Elizabeth is a stunning actress and the casting is really good too. Highly recommend!!"
1 March 2021,L O V E IT !,10.0,I JUMPED INTO THE show around ep 3 and got into it and then 4 and then 5 and then it got to a point where i went back to the beginning at ep1 and just watched it and it was awesome ... you have to be patient with the first 2 eps its like a get a clue kind of vibe thru the episode and then episode 3 -4-5-it just keeps gettting better and better i just watched 8 cant wait for 9
15 October 2021,I don't care for the MCU shows but this one is good,9.0,I just find the shows to often be lower budget watered down and boring spin offs of the movies. But this one does something very different with it's creative use of sitcoms through the ages.
6 March 2021,When Marvel Studios makes series,10.0,
10 April 2021,The most original show I've ever watched,10.0,First thing it takes till episode 4 to get really into it so stick with it don't give up on it. The plot is original and the acting is amazing. Trust me when your done watching this you'll love the show. One of the best television shows I've ever watched.
18 March 2021,Phenomenal Transition into Television,9.0,"An incredible transition from cinema to TV, Wandavision is unique brilliance, that must be appreciated for what it is in each component part. The early episodes are a far cry from what many would have expected from the series, but if judged by what they truly are, still great. The early, fun 50/60s sitcoms are a perfect replication of what they are representing. Don't read too much into them, they're there to be enjoyed. But they do leave jarring clues as to where the series will progress.

As the series progresses, the ratio of cheerful fun to eerie psychological thriller transitions in a perfect fashion. The transitions between eras, too, are performed so well. Not just the acting or the script, but the colour and aspect ratio switches. Each episode has something fresh but retrospective, it's so engaging.

Story wise, it is the most intelligent thing Marvel have released in a while. Links to dozens of films, fleshing out backstories for many characters, hinting at the future and Easter eggs galore. Such a deep dive into a past and a psyche, engrossing the whole time through the build up.

The climax maybe doesn't reach the heights of the build up. Each episode created another exciting element and created a fizz of apprehension, but the climax, whilst still great, wasn't quite as good as the excitement generated. It still finishes a brilliant arc though, and sets a lot up for the future of the saga.

Those who have not watched the MCU can still enjoy it, those who have will love it, those who are borderline obsessive about the universe will wet themselves at times."
21 March 2023,An unusual tribute to sitcoms,8.0,"This Marvel series begins in a rather peculiar and curious way. The series acts as a tribute to different comedy series from different eras. He does it in an interesting way as the series becomes a rather unusual mix. We see a Wanda who tries to continue with her life, but living in a bubble created by herself. The fascinating thing here is that she is understanding more about her powers and also about her past. Everything that led her to become what she is, and here her transformation is completed. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are the highlights of the series, they make a very good couple with their characters. WandaVision is a series that begins as a fun comedy and then offers the dose of special effects that are never lacking in Marvel installments. My rating for this series is 8/10."
15 January 2021,"When you scroll down, that's when you'll reach the REAL reviews and not the paid ones!",7.0,It's utterly boring and it's headed absolutely nowhere. DROP for sure. Doesn't matter if it's just the start or just 2 episodes. It's enough as it is.
10 March 2021,Marvel's most emotional production yet,9.0,"WandaVision is not perfect. My 9/10 rating isn't quite accurate but I think 8 is too low. The series begins focusing on different sitcoms which I loved. I didn't find it boring, but at the same time, I felt like the mysterious moments were the best parts of those episodes. I think people cared too much about fan theories. I wish I didn't know any theories so I could enjoy the series for the marvelous, beautiful and emotional series it is. The best moments of this series are the dramatic and emotional ones. I think Marvel relies on action. I love action but I like the dramatic direction this series went in instead. Elizabeth Olsen deserves an emmy. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Bettany should get one too."
31 January 2021,"A bit slow, but interesting and enjoyable nonetheless",7.0,"It's quite enjoyable, but it definitely is not what you'd expect. I feel like watching it once all episodes are released rather than waiting each week would be more preferable as it feels like it may have been intended to be viewed that way."
10 January 2022,Nominated for Golden Globes???,9.0,"And well-deserved!

Although I have mixed feelings about the Marvel / Disney TV shows overall, I was onboard with WandaVision and the performances of Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (not to mention the creativity of the writers) really made that show special.

Fun show, heartfelt performances."
29 January 2021,Little Red Riding Hood Marries the Tin Man,1.0,"A comedy about two of the most ridiculous Marvel superheroes. Wanda the Scarlet Witch, who wears a red grill on her head, and a little red riding hood outfit, marries The Vision, who is an android that was vaporized by Thanos back in Avengers Infinity.

The two of them want to make babies, except that The Vision only shoots blanks from his robo-vibrator. So much romance and comedy here! Why do they want to make this train wreck into ""I Love Lucy?"""
29 January 2021,You Can't Properly Rate Something Until It's Over,9.0,"I was thrown by the bad reviews and then I watched till the end of episode 4. Obviously ppl have been crapping on this show without even giving it a fair shot.

I'm not a huge superhero/marvel/avenger kind of guy but this show is awesome and I cannot wait until the next episode.

Wandavision's overall score jumped from 6 to 7.5 since the release of episode 4, that's got to tell you something!"
10 March 2021,Nice transition to TV!,8.0,"Original, bold and doesn't take itself to seriously - a surprising solid mini series from Marvel!

The topic of the hour, the most recent bet Marvel is going to make is a bunch of TV series announced some time ago, and it starts off with second tier characters (which don't have a standalone movie of their own) Wanda and Vision. The initial episodes are strange and completely out of context from what Marvel usually makes, but that's actually the beauty of it, this works unexpectedly well, and if you give it a shot (it's only 9 episodes so a very short series compared to what's coming out these days) you'll have all the answers for the questions you will be asking for the first 4 episodes. Another positive aspect of this, is the 20-40 minute average per episode, it makes it more engaging and there wasn't a single boring period I felt while watching this series.

The initial set takes us to what seems to be a sitcom starring the well known heroes and their boring life in the American suburbs, and for the first 4 episodes the tone continues, with silly comedy and a laughing track as we move through the decades and the evolution of sitcom. Here and there, we notice some odd events that start to foreshadow the plot that is developed over the course of the final episodes, and this is what makes the series thrive, the mixture of odd and mystery.

Once we start to get some answers and be more emerged in what we are used to in the Marvel cinematic universe, at first I enjoyed it as long as you are a Marvel fan and you have your mind opened for the fact that this is super hero fantasy - but over the course of the last episode, it felt it was a bit cliché which is again something Marvel always had, yet with the first episodes I was hoping they would keep the originality throughout the whole show. There are some revelations, which might be interesting for hardcore Marvel fans who know these characters outside the movies, from the actual comics, yet I found myself doing a bit of research to check on the newly introduced characters and how this is suppose to start the next stage of Marvel movies and TV shows.

In short, it's original, entertaining and keeps you engaged throughout, it becomes more ""Marvel"" from episode 5 and after, and it reaches your usual Marvel movie on the series finale - I must say I am excited to see what they do over the course of the next planned TV shows!"
5 March 2021,Great Show,10.0,What a wonderful show this was. Loved it. Looking forward to many many more.
5 March 2021,Elizabeth Olsen is absolutely stunning!,10.0,
13 March 2021,Don't judge it after 2 episodes,10.0,"Wadavision is one of the best mcu projects, especially fans of the comics will have a great time finding the little clues in the first few episodes that lead to the villain but also to smaller details. The first two episodes however aren't the thing what you expected, but you'll find yourself enjoying the show at least after episode 4. Wandavisions follows the story of Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) after the events of End game. This series also includes some reference to House of M (marvel comic) and many hints to marvel comic characters. Everyone who loves a show that isn't to revealing will love Wandavision too, although you should've at least watched the mcu movies including Wanda (especially Infinity War and End game) to understand some character decisions."
16 March 2021,"A concept, thats it.",,"WandaVision had me captivated from the very beginning posing many questions to what is even going on while also creating an enjoyable reference to old television poking fun at it too. Although later in the story mediocre acting with very predictable outcomes with some plotlines just completely forgotten about it takes away so much from the original charm this show had going for it. From bad costumes to cgi fight scenes, the whole bag of badness."
15 January 2021,Hated the first 2 episodes.,1.0,They were so cringe. And one of the worst things is that mcu fans are bloating the ratings for this showed even though its an utter downgrade from the films.
20 March 2021,Solid MCU Show!,8.0,
28 April 2021,Better than TFATWS,8.0,"Came here after finishing Falcon And The Winter soldier and i have to say WandaVision was better. Sure the first two episodes of WandaVision are a snooze fest, but it's needed to make the future episodes even better. The ending could have been a little better but overall this show is solid and is slightly above average for the MCU. I would give it a 8/10 ."
28 March 2021,nah,5.0,"Some original concepts, but overall it didn't grab my attention. Much of the story and characters i couldn't care less about. So i have to give it props for originality but not much beyond that.

5/10: original but boring."
16 January 2021,"UGH - YES, I ""get"" it",,"And I HATE it. I did appreciate the homage to ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" set.

But, to use a ""Southern"" phrase, ""this is SO precious.""

Yes, I've only seen one episode, and it will be my last. Yes, I am aware that the first episode, is only the hint of things to come. BUT, it failed. Silly.

Not interested..."
5 March 2021,"Boring, underwhelming & stale ending",3.0,
7 March 2021,A poignant meditation on grief,10.0,"I think what was truly phenomenal about this show is not only the way in which it details the history of American television for the past 70 years and reflects on the role of women in those shows, but indeed the resonant portrayal of Wanda's profound grief. I feel in many ways this show could not have come out at a more poignant time, around a year into the pandemic where many of us have experienced grief. Moreover, I'm sure the idea of creating our own fantasy world to stem that grief and pain would sadly appeal to many of us at this desperate time. Watching this show every Friday has been a true treat, a form of escapism from everyday reality - much like Wanda is escaping reality herself. The show therefore in many respects is reflecting life back at us in a strange way, and I think we can all appreciate the multi-layered magnificence that is this show. The meditation on grief and loss was so poignant, and Elizabeth Olsen should seriously be considered for an Emmy nomination for her work in this show, as well as Paul and Kathryn."
26 February 2021,What a ride (so far),10.0,After Episode 9 everything starts to make sense. I congratulate Marvel/Disney for such a bold move.
4 November 2021,Mystery and suspense,7.0,"This series begins in a strange manner and keeps unfolding each player as the story progresses. It leaves you with questions and answers then in time. It is a masterpiece that was well writen until it loses sight of what made it beautiful.

The third act feels like a typical marvel movie.

I was shocked by who the villain was. It caught me offguard lol.

But the ending was disappointing."
15 March 2021,It was Marvel all along!,9.0,"I was curious when it was announced that various characters would be getting their own shows on Disney +. The MCU for many years has always been the big screen and i admit i was skeptical about the changing format, and i can't deny i loved every minute of it!

Picking Wanda was a wonderful choice to start the Disney + shows, it gives her Character so much development that was lightly touched upon in the main movies. The Storyline starts off rather confusing, but as the episodes move forward things start to fall into place with a satisfying conclusion.

It left me looking forward to what will happen next with Wanda in Dr Strange, as well other characters such a Monica and how they will continue with her story in the movies / shows moving forward.

If you're a fan of the MCU then this show is a must watch!"
17 January 2021,Perfect as it is,10.0,I think people who rated this as 1 star expected some epic Infinity Wars or Endgame style tv show and they have never read any comic books in their life. Updating from 9 to 10 after the 4th episode. Very clever! I knew it was very creative but I didn't see where the story was going until now.
10 March 2021,I'm hurt by how good this was,10.0,"Marvel really gave a character room to breath. Those caught up in spoilers and fan theories really missed out on the point of this show, which is to explore the depth of Wandas character and of the grief that she, like so many MCU characters, is processing. Beautiful acting. Wonderful design. What a story. Don't get wrapped up in what each episode means for the MCU, just take it for what it is, a beautiful tragic story about love, loss, fate, and strength."
16 January 2021,I can't score as I don't understand,,What the heck is this? I'm not a comic book person so maybe I am just confused but this show is a cross between Leave it to Beaver and Bewitched. Do they allow pot at Disney Studios now? I'll keep giving it a try but please start to help us understand what in the heck is going on.
16 January 2021,Fantastic idea,10.0,"Me and my mate just watched the first two episodes, then spent the next hour or so breaking it down and sifting through the clues. A bit of comic knowledge along with knowing the MCU made these episodes something special. I understand the one star reviews though, 'cause thinking is hard..."
15 January 2021,The Beginning of Marvel Studios Phase 4,9.0,
10 April 2022,This character deserved better,4.0,"To get right to the point, this show (miniseries?), with its high production values and fruitful concept is utterly crippled by pacing issues. Developments don't really start to happen until you're four episodes in, and from there, sporadic is being generous. It's a major letdown because this is the story of Wanda dealing with her grief, and that has potential. But the writers spend three episodes hammering away at the ode to classic sitcoms, and that starts to feel like a gimmick in no time. It serves a story purpose, sure, and patience will be rewarded with answers, but this could've been tightened to six episodes easily. And to end things with a generic Marvel CGI fight adds to the disappointment. . . . Wanda still deserves her due. I like Elizabeth Olsen in the MCU and the post-Endgame era is fertile ground to spotlight her pain, but it still feels like she's getting short-changed.

I have to beg off of this one, it's not something I want to revisit."
20 February 2021,Ignore the fanboys/girls who rate this a 9 or 10!,2.0,"You have to wonder about people who rate this stuff 9 or 10. I mean what are they comparing it to? (""The Masked Singer is soooo awesome!"") MCU/Comic book stuff is limited to begin with. The only things not below average in this show is the budget and visual effects. This is MCU lite/light. That's find to have a less dark, less intense version of the MCU, but so far the character archs are very predictable. The story and the execution are bland and unengaging."
25 February 2021,Okay okay people have their own ideas of what they like but this is bad!,4.0,I'm just not a fan of marvel but I do like winter soldier. WandaVision feels like long division.
8 September 2021,Don't make High expectations,7.0,Not that bad probably the first episodes aren't logical enough but it getting better not the best show but also not the worst simply you can watch it for enjoyment and nice visual experience.
2 April 2021,Garbage.. it was a bad attempt,2.0,"YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! THIS IS CRAP! No idea why people rated this as good because for me it was garbage. Dumb storyline and a rip off of old TV shows in an attempt to produce something interesting. If you have to watch this, skip ahead and watch the last 2 or 3 episodes. The first ones are so bad and slow it is a waste of time. For me as a long-time Marvel fan this was a complete waste of time. You can fast forward through the 1st 7 episodes and you would not miss anything. Yes, it is that bad! Worst of the Marvel series or movies I have yet to see. And the fact that Wanda had to battle a villain that was so ridiculous made it an even bigger joke. Suggest you consider watching the 10-15 mins recap on YouTube."
7 February 2023,Yes! Finally something unexpected,9.0,"This show has been wonderful or should I say, ""wandaful""!?

In two episodes so far but it's a pleasure to watch both the main and side characters bring classic pure humor back so well! Thank whomever is making this kind approach to entertainment.

The switch from drab that saturated the screen for long enough is refreshing. I love Agnes and her neighborly adages as well as the neighborly characters at the workplace with Vision. So far I want to share this show with others and have actually laughed genuinely at liners that come together well in this setting. The mystery of reality lurking in the show so far is intriguing and I can see how one just follows the scenes for surprises. Great acting here!"
6 March 2021,A gateway to the realm of magic and madness.,9.0,WandaVision is a creative and a unique work of Marvel. The show started from being a sitcom to the mind-boggling finale Marvel really did presented us one of their best work in term of uniqueness and creativity. Elizabeth Olsen really stole the show her performance was so good also one cannot ignore the great support from Paul Bettany. This show really did opened a new door and a new beginning of what next to come in Marvel. Overall a great feat for Marvel Studios.
20 March 2021,So far so good.,10.0,"Nice to see Scarlet Witch(Wanda) and The Vision get there own series, have not seen the whole series yet, but I have a feeling it will get better has it goes on, I know there is more to what I've seen so far, great homage to classic sitcoms, like The Donna Reed Show(1958 - 1966) and Bewitched(1964 - 1972), to name a few.







Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olson really look like they are having a blast getting back in there roles, and playing the old style T.V.. I excited to see more to what this show has to offer."
2 April 2021,Wildly creative,8.0,"I'm not particularly into the Marvel Universe and I genuinely enjoyed this show. It's not perfect, but it gets so many things right: a very creative theme, a solid story, great characters, good acting and fairly bite-sized episodes.

This is a spinoff done right and in a time and age of undeniable creative drought - at least in Hollywood -, this a very welcome puff of fresh air. And I'll be looking forward to the next one."
15 January 2021,erie,8.0,"Strange screeplay. i cant tell were is going with it, but its intriguing. silly as those old shows. Wanda is charming. I want to see more."
15 January 2021,Horrible... green lantern horrible,1.0,Horrible... it is just dumb. Cannot believe this is a marvel production. The first episode just does not end
31 December 2021,Solid Ten,10.0,The plot was great. The acting was great. The action and the CGIS were great. I loved the fact that they experimented with that series .Need I say more?
15 February 2021,LOVE IT PLEASE SEE THAT ......,10.0,MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE IS GREAT. I LOVE THE SHOW AND THE EP 5 AND 6 DESERVE 10 OUT OF 10. LOVED IT PLEASE WATCH THE SHOW
24 December 2021,Pure heartbreak,10.0,THE PRODUCTION ON THIS! The story! The special effects! The emotions! This really is a masterpiece. It deserves all the love it got. It really does :)
6 March 2021,"Heartache, Superpowers and Mystery",9.0,"Although the start of this series will leave you scratching your head.. but as you watch - and if you're a marvel fan and have watched and followed all the movies to date, you'll see familiar faces.

Watch along and follow the unraveling of a mystery behind this show. You may also feel for Wanda if you yourself has also ever grieved for a lost loved one. Sometimes when you've greatly lost someone you love, you would also wish you had the ability to retreat into a fantasy world where they were still alive.

But not everything is as it seems in this town, and mystery always build good plots. Especially in a series where people have superpowers."
23 February 2021,A great addition to the MCU Canon.,8.0,"It really does pick up the pace after the first two episodes; sure some may find it a little too weird for their own tastes, but I'm glad WandaVision went for its experimental retro-TV aesthetic taking pages from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s and 2010s. Who knows what the final episode will pay homage to: or foreshadow in regards to the MCU.

Marvel is bridging the arts of film and television in the same way LucasFilm managed to do with Disney+'s other breakout hit: The Mandalorian. The barriers between film and television are so thin now that streaming services are taking advantage of the thin line between the two. WandaVision is like a glimpse into the future of television whilst looking to the past at the same time.

It's a good show: and the wait was worth it for Marvel-fans eager for Disney+ to release MCU-shows on the service. And it's going to grow quite a lot in the future.

WandaVision gets a solid 4/5 stars for me. It's a promising new phase for Marvel's future in television, and thinning the line between film and television."
7 March 2021,Truly Enjoyed Every Bit Of It!!!,10.0,Okay - maybe the first episode or two were a little slow - but across the board - loved it all! Thought it was great fun!
16 January 2021,Wholesome weirdness,8.0,Wanda vision is a bold direction paying homage to TV history that mixes early 1960s wholesomeness with a touch of the really weird. It's flirting with a mystery that hints at quantum mechanics and/or alternate realities that might be taking place in the mind of Wanda. It's a risky creative Vision that is going to pay off in spades. No pun intended.
6 March 2021,"Wow, far exceeded my expectations",10.0,"I waited until I'd seen all of the episodes to review WandaVision. Previously, I had liked the characters, I had liked the actors, and I had expected the show to be mildly entertaining. I wasn't prepared to be blown away emotionally. WandaVision feels to me as though it's channeling the grief and frustration we've been dealing with for a year now. Experiencing WandaVision was very cathartic."
15 January 2021,Overrated and Overhyped by Fanboys,1.0,"What you hated about Friends and The Big Bang Theory ( Laugh tracks on lame jokes forcing you to laugh), Snyder cut trailer ( Weird aspect ratio and B/W) all rolled into one disguised as a satirical view on soap opera to distract you from the fact that it is mediocre at it's best. No built up intrigue and absence of interesting characters leave it unwatchable. First impression is the last impression except when you know the MCU is backing this."
19 October 2021,An overrated series,4.0,"A series that started very well for the first 3 episodes, interesting and fascinating. Then at the end it was ruined so much that it gave it 4 stars. He had sown a lot but then didn't wet the ground. Too much stuff that wasn't fixed. The real problem is the script !!"
5 March 2021,"A Risky, Yet Very Satisfying Addition to the MCU",9.0,"This is the type of series that was ripe for disappointment right off the bat. Black Widow was supposed to be the next film to be released after Avengers: Endgame, but instead, the schedule needed to be shifted, thus having us receive WandaVision first. Marvel expanding their world and continue their franchise with a television series felt like a massive leap forward and I have always felt nervous about it, given that asking fans to both see movies in theatres and watch series' on Disney+ may turn out to be a bit much when going back to restart the franchise. Thankfully, those fears were put to rest after viewing WandaVision, at least for now. If you have followed this franchise from the very beginning and are eager for more, here's why WandaVision demands your attention.

After the events of Avengers: Endgame, this franchise could've chosen hundreds of places to start with each character. Beginning small and weird in a black and white sitcom setting was not what I expected, but it felt refreshing after such a massive climax. The first few episodes are really meant to be enjoyed as a sitcom, as things around the main characters slowly begin to reveal themselves. This series begins with Wanda and Vision living a classic dream sitcom life, but as each episode progresses and time periods change, along with revealing the outside world and what is really going on, there is never a dull moment here.

It's difficult to pinpoint just one or two great performances here. This is the best that both Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany have both been in this franchise, bar none. There are a handful of sequences toward the end of this series that brought me to tears, simply due to their commitment to these characters. Outside of these incredible performances, even the townspeople around them were unnerving. There are one or two scenes in particular where I found the way a performer would switch back and forth between personas to be very well-done. The way this series plays out and reveals new things wouldn't have worked unless everything about this suburban town felt authentic, and it absolutely did.

If you haven't seen any pieces of the story that lead up to this series for these two characters, I really can't recommend checking it out because the emotional backbone with these two characters is why I loved the series overall. The series builds to a scene that I both wanted and was very satisfied with, so any questions that have yet to be answered I'm sure will follow throughout the franchise. On many occasions, I believed this series was going in a much bigger and weird direction than it did, but I also believe that this was just a taste of what is to come, so I also appreciate it for holding back too.

I could dive into so many details about why this series was so great, but I don't wish to ruin it for viewers, but rather express why they should check it out. Overall, I believe WandaVision exists to lay the groundwork for a much grander story that will play out in films to come. With that mindset, I thought everything about this series was fantastic. From the clever riff on sitcoms to the introduction of possible alternate realities, to the look and feel of watching an actual Marvel film on the big screen, I had no complaints really. This was something that really hadn't been done before and I have to commend them for that. It may be hard for some viewers to latch onto this story at first, but again if you've seen the films that preceded it, the emotional impact that the final episode has will be totally worth it. Especially for fans of this franchise, I can't recommend WandaVision enough. All episodes are now streaming on Disney+."
16 July 2021,"Quirky, unique and mysterious",9.0,"Quirky, unique and mysterious, WandaVision, started phase 4 of the MCU in superb fashion. There is nothing quite like this series and I wonder if there ever will be. I left each episode confused (in a good way) and wondering how everything was going to come together. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany fully embraced the unconventional approach on storytelling and delivered brilliant performances. While Wanda's powers have grown from powerful to extraordinary, I am curious to see how the little guys (like Sam, Scott and Clint) can keep up. Even with the previous core players gone, the future is bright for the MCU in the hands of this new generation of heroes."
15 January 2021,"joke reviews or just stupid, YOU DECIDE",3.0,"I would not usually give a low rating to a subject matter i actually like (mcu), but if after two full episodes it has done nothing at all to keep me interested there is obviously something wrong with a tv series. I am sure at some stage in the series it will make sense (of a sort) and its possible i may actually like it, but two episodes of an unfunny and un-interesting bewitched style series does not a decent series make, and why the producers thought it would is beyond me unless its when do make the series interesting, the 1st 2 episodes being so bad would make people rate future episodes much higher in comparison? Whatever their reasons for making such mundane tripe as the 1st two episodes, i can only hope its not the shape of things to come for the MCU"
2 February 2021,Amazing!,10.0,"Honestly if this was a movie instead of a TV show it would be one of my all time favourite Marvel Movies and it's not even done yet! The mystery, the Easter eggs and the excitement is just fantastic!"
29 November 2021,Touching. Lovely message. Tied together perfectly.,10.0,"The series started off completely random, no explaination but then it was well tied up together and explained. The only minus point is its too short. I want to see Wanda in action more."
16 January 2021,I'm amazed at how Bad TV has gotten,3.0,"In My mind there were three very different periods where TV peaked the 50s mid 70s to early 80s...and the Seinfeld Era ending by season 5 of 2 & 1/2 men and Everybody Loves Raymond. Dick Van Dyke, The Honeymooners, the Twilight Zone, Perry Mason timeless classics...depending on taste people will throw in variety shows personally Abbot & Costello Show, also The Alfred Hitchcock series. A few gems in the 60s not many. The 70s peak can only be appreciated with an understanding of what was going on after 12-13 years in Vietnam, Nixon paranoia and the recession and energy crisis, very liberal agendas that just made crime go through the roof, and the assassination of MLK Jr...shows like All in the Family, Marry Tyler Moore, Mash, Star Trek late 60s, Barney Miller, The Equalizer...some more depressing sitcoms that had to insert some morality lesson like Good Times, Welcome Back Carter and even Soap which just went from funny to political liberal propaganda....prime time dramas were just as ridiculous as day time soaps. The 80s in the day you either liked soaps, game shows and cartoons...Then daytime was hijacked by ridiculous talk shows by Phil Donahue...then Oprah robbed the crown...creating entertaining but repetitive Maury...and my only Favorite May she enjoy her retirement Judge Judy! In the 80s just pour on the cheesiest worst family shows including Cosby...Home improvement with Cheeers being really a prelude to Seinfeld. Seinfeld broke the barriers pointed out hypocrisy in ourselves as if each character represented a part of ourselves the angry and embittered, the happy go lucky child, the responsible mature one, and the let's party like it's Studio 54 nut, with an even funnier ensemble surrounding them. Which occurred simultaneously with the first ""office"" show but surrounding a fictional talk show The Larry Sanders show, a successful character spinoff with Frazier, and the first really funny family show Everybody Loves Raymond...Some will argue the first 5 seasons of 2.5 Men...but in honesty it was straight vulgarity. Outside of Curb the only funny I've seen on the gamut of streaming and channels is Curb and dark humor. HBO originals haven't put out a compelling show since The Sopranos, Curb, Sex and The City, and Entourage..One can argue OZ and Tracy Ulman if they wish. Then there is all this hype with ""Wandavision"". Even without the sitcoms mentioned above, I had to shut it off 15 minutes in. I don't know what the anticipation was for, I saw an attempted mockery of Lucy, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Bewitched, and Jeanie (the last two should be mocked)... but the mockery wasn't funny...actually the only thing comical was the theme, music and clearly periods of laugh tracks which were not effective. This show is moronic, for individuals and families and the only thing it accomplishes it makes the Mandalorian look like genius. I should get a free month of Disney+ just for entertaining the idea of trying this garbage out...I couldn't power to the end of the Pilot that's how uneventful and lame it was."
24 April 2021,Wandavision Is So Compelling!,10.0,"This show is great, been hyped since the reveal I knew this was going to be something special. Wanda and Vision are two underrated characters I always wanted to get their own movie but a show is just as good in my opinion. If you're a marvel fan who follows the MCU accordingly then this is definitely worth the watch and hey even if you aren't I still think this show was very enjoyable.

Had to give it a 10 as in my opinion they did an amazing job!"
15 February 2021,A Masterpiece,10.0,"This is one of Marvels most intricate pieces, if you haven't seen any of Marvel's previous movies it can be a little confusing but despite that you will still find it very very interesting. It's like a gift that keep on giving. However, it can be quite slow in the beginning it is definitely worth it towards the end. Arguably, Marvel's best tv series."
9 June 2021,"Appalling, by far the worst Marvel program",1.0,"I'm a big Marvel fan and wanted this to be good, but it's far from that. The first four episodes are almost entirely a remake of I Love Lucy from the 1960s. There's a reason shows aren't made like that anymore, it was painful and cringey with non stop cheesy jokes. Paul Bethany as Vision could just about pull it off but Elizabeth Olsen can't act her way out of a bag. When the plot finally gets going not much happens and when it does it's underwhelming, the fan theories at the time were far more interesting than what actually happened.

Yes, they tried something new but it didn't work. I've watched one episode of the new MODOK show and already it's a million times better than this."
21 March 2021,Good but overrated.,7.0,WandaVision is a fun show to watch in your free time. But it's not something important or necessary in my opinion. I watched 9 episodes but only a couple of them were actually good and serve a purpose in the bigger picture of the MCU. The show is very light and entertaining but I don't get why people are overhyping it a lot on social media.
6 March 2021,A FANTASTIC SERIES,9.0,"While ""WandaVision"" had a pretty okay episode 1 and 2, episode 3 onwards gave us everything we could ask for (except for a longer running time), a fantastic series with terrific acting, nearly perfect storytelling a great twist and another great Marvel villain. This series, on its own, is a promising start to Disney+'s Marvel tv series"
6 March 2021,Just brilliant,10.0,"I am not one to give a 10 easily. Just a fantastic piece of entertainment. From the acting, storyline and effects. I can't wait for season 2. Also don't miss all the post credit scenes. There are 2 in final episode."
15 January 2021,"No Action, It's a Love Story and Soap Opera + I Love Genie Ripoff",4.0,"I have seen the first two episodes only and my review will be based upon that only at this time. This show appears to be a love story comedy and soap opera all rolled into one long and boring I Love Genie copy. For those of you that have seen the I Love Genie tv show from many decades past, it is a very similar show in both story and execution. For that I automatically subtract points on originality. The fact that it's a dramatic love story makes it a far departure from what Marvel has traditionally provided for us. As of the first few episodes there is no action at all, no super hero adventures, no super villains that we are aware of beyond the next door neighbour who may be part of something nefarious. That has yet to be known, but what is known is that this show is boring for me. The very fact that they put the Marvel name on this show leads one to believe that there would be some super hero action and adventure, but the only adventure we ever receive was none at all!

I am sorry to say that this show receives a 4/10 from me. The acting is good by the protagonists but no amount of great acting can save an overall very poor effort at writing this story and script. Overall, don't waste your time trying to be entertained by this stinker of a show. I will check back in after a few more episodes in case things improve."
19 March 2021,definitely worth the watch,8.0,"If you don't count the last episode I think it's great (they either rushed it or didn't really know how to end in a TV budget) the format is great, the writing is great and if you are a marvel nerd it gives enough Easter eggs to keep you hipped, just enjoy it not expecting anything like endgame"
23 January 2021,"Slow progress continues, no interest in gimmick",5.0,"The gimmick of characters stuck in old TV series is an interesting concept but... in itself is not enough to hold my interest. Each episode drags on and towards the end will lurch slightly forward, This may give hope that the next episode will reveal more, have more energy, some great payoff but.. the same boring cycle just repeats itself each week. The monotony of a writer who loves their ""clever"" concept so much that they forget to entertain us. What surprises me is the praise from some other reviewers. IMHO WandaVision is not in the same league with shows that have preceded. Give me Jessica Simpson or The Boys instead of this snooze-fest any day."
27 July 2021,A new Experiment which worked really well,8.0,"Pros 1- A sitcom turned action series with fantasy and family drama, it has everything.

2-more information regarding wanda's history is given.

3-One more last look at Vision.

4-New experiment worked well for me.

Cons 1- Last episode was kinda dragged.

2- I couldn't get into the Music/OST."
23 February 2021,Lots of Fun,7.0,"This show has been a nice little mystery, revealing pieces bit by bit. Visually, it's amazing, and the sitcom conceit has been hilarious. I am biased in that I like these characters already and know some of the backstory, and I feel like that adds to my enjoyment. I thought it had a bit of a slow build over the first few episodes, but as more and more gets revealed, it totally pays off. Is it just for fans? I would be curious to know what people going in uninformed would think."
15 January 2021,"10 minutes each episode??? and they look like made with $100 dollars,this is not a SHOW!! it's a scam",1.0,"2 years waiting for this?? and they give us just these tiny short cheap episodes??? looks like the budget for this show would be $100 bucks, maybe less, and the episodes have a ton of filling, just like most series have when their episodes last like 50 min or 1 hr, but this is RIDICULOUS, the intro, opening and ending credits of each ep are longer than THE ACTUAL EPISODES!! I mean, really?¡ this has to be a joke, I didn't pay Disney subscription for the cheapest and shortest series in history, this is nonsense, they should have done a movie or a trilogy with a high budget and 3 hours long each one, this series format is senseless, maybe when the series is fully released we reach to 1 hour of real content, but not even with all the episodes together we would fill an average 2 hrs film, I feel scammed. On the other hand, the show idea is GREAT! if it had a high budget like marvel movies and a movie format I would prob rank it with 10!!! and the acting of both, Eli and Paul are oustanding as always, 1 star only for that! :)"
5 September 2021,Simply astonishing piece of art,10.0,"This is not a series, it's art.

I was completely stunned that Marvel Studios/Disney could come up with such a unique and original story which is absolutely captivating, let alone execute it in all perfection.

Wanda's sorrow hits close to home and Elizabeth's acting is as breathtaking as she was in Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011).

I can't understand how it wasn't awarded multiple Emmy's. I want to see more of these writers and Elizabeth."
18 March 2021,WandaVision is like nothing we have ever seen before in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.,10.0,"We viewers thought it would be exhausting for Disney+ to film more mini-series for most of the side characters' journeys after Avengers: Endgame, if a solo story for them wasn't short enough for a single 2-to-3-hour movie. Before and during COVID-19, we just wanted to get through the final two seasons of Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. and hope for Chloe Wang (Daisy Johnson) to spin-off into her own Marvel movie as the main superhero agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., but until we get our Daisy Johnson dream movie to rise Chloe Bennet, WandaVision is a breath of fresh air for not being more of the same superhero action drama. In the long run, I get the feeling WandaVision might get more views on Disney+ than most 2021 Marvel mini-series and come out on top of the algorithm. In 2018, the airing of Family Guy Through the Years and the announcement of Disney+ were the metaphorical parents of WandaVision. WandaVision was the only new Marvel series of 2021 to finish filming before COVID-19, which is why we got to see it before The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. WandaVision truly is the feel-good story we all needed that later gets real with us about dealing with grief. WandaVision was filmed at just the right time for multiple reasons. It was filmed during the 11th and final season of Modern Family, the newest situation comedy from which a WandaVision episode borrowed its identity, and both programs' last days of filming came in weeks before the coronavirus lockdown started. WandaVision premiered right on its time 2021, as many of us were either resting in quarantine like Wanda was in the 2000s episode, or can relate to Wanda and Monica losing a sick loved one after the Coronavirus in 2020. It was even more tragic that Chloe Wang in real life got the virus a year after Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. was finished. I watched all 9 episodes with my mom over the course of the previous 3 days before I wrote this review, and it was amazing!

WandaVision is perfect for Marvel and Disney+ (until the final episode) because it tries something completely different from typical Marvel fare. It is like Family Guy Through the Years, but 72 times cooler because each storyline is 4/3 as long as they were in Family Guy since every decade gets its own episode in WandaVision rather than 3 segments in 1, WandaVision goes through all 6 decades instead of just 3, ranging from the 1950s to the 2000s, and WandaVision has 9 episodes to tell the whole story, so we have an additional 3 episodes about the outside antagonistic forces from outside the safe WandaVision bubble. The best part about Wanda Maximoff Through the Years is that it is NOT a parody of sitcoms. I believe Jac Schaeffer and Matt Shakman's claims about that because...while all 6 WandaVision episodes may parody opening sequences and commercials from every decade, the main narrative of WandaVision doesn't really parody sitcoms, despite setting up Wanda's home to look like the family houses of some of them. However, I never found out if they intended the same thing for their commercials. Jac Schaeffer and Elizabeth Olsen are really writing a situation comedy around Wanda and Vision, with the darker twist of unraveling a mystery throughout the episodes. They are a witch and a humanoid robot pretending to be a regular married couple in the idyllic town of Westview, New Jersey, and something strange is afoot because Wanda and Vision have no real memories of their wedding. Vision goes to work every day without a clue as what his job is supposed to be, but as a ""walking computer,"" he is very good at it, at filing applications.

I respect the elaborate production value of WandaVision. Everyone making WandaVision went to ""sitcom boot camp."" Matt Shakman, the director, was around for situation comedies from the 1980s to the present 2020s, and he acted in Growing Pains when he was a child actor in the 1980s, so he knew how to style the interior of Wanda's house after them, but for the older sitcom looks of the 1950s and 1960s, Dick Van Dyke was an uncredited consultant. Kat Dennings and Randall Park both played a main character in situation comedies from the 2010s,. It really helps to have people from all 3 generations of sitcoms making WandaVision! Wanda's magic in the 1950s also emulates the older magic special effects of Bewitched. Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, and Kathryn Hahn also change their acting style and voices whenever WandaVision moves forward a decade. Elizabeth Olsen grew up watching her older twin sisters on Full House, so watching situation comedies were a large part of her childhood before she got to play Wanda, who also grew up with classic situation comedies. Even though she has never done voice acting before, I can tell Elizabeth might be pretty good at it because when I paid attention to her changing tone of voice throughout the decades, it really sounded like she did voices like Mary Tyler Moore, Elizabeth Montgomery, Meredith Baxter, and Julie Bowen in addition to having clothes and hair like the characters they were playing.

WandaVision was a great show from start to finish. It never was a parody of situation comedies from each decade, but a pastiche of sitcoms with a deeper, darker mystery underneath. It really turned our world upside down because while Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany were serious action hero actors who had to learn how to be situation comedy actors for 4 months, Kat Dennings and Randall Park were both 2010s sitcom actors whose side characters from Thor and Ant-Man and the Wasp carried the more the serious parts of the story. Maybe someday soon I can give Elizabeth Olsen another comedy series that isn't as twisty-turny as WandaVision. When I wrote this review, Godzilla and Wind River were her only non-Wanda movie roles to pass 100,000 votes in 2 years. It was kind of cool how WandaVision even made its own commercials that parodied other commercials from the time of each episode, and included the actors from those commercials in the episode's cast list. It was the funniest running meta joke I have seen since Zardip's Search for Healthy Wellness interrupted every program for a special message about health. Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, Evan Peters, Debra Jo Rupp, Fred Melamed, Randall Park, Kat Dennings, Kathryn Hahn, and plenty more did a terrific job blending comedy with serious acting. I also need to give a big shout-out to the stars of our commercials, Victoria Blade and Ithamar Enriquez. They put just as much effort as the main show actors did into dressing like earlier decades, and I was really caught off guard by how much they looked like Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in the first commercial, from the 1950s episode. It was like watching Vic Mignogna, Todd Haberkorn and Chuck Huber become the new William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley in Star Trek Continues.

If WandaVision's first season is also its last, then I and Elizabeth Olsen can move on with our lives. If WandaVision gets to have a second season 2 years from now, there are loads of other genres and types of shows these days that WandaVision could turn into to move Wanda's story along, like a crime drama or an iCarly-type web series, a Crazy Ex-Girlfriend-type musical or even an animated kids' program. It could even go backwards in time by turning into sitcoms set in an earlier decade than they were made, like Fresh Off the Boat, Everybody Hates Chris, That 70s Show, The Wonder Years, Happy Days, and Hogan's Heroes. My only real disappointment for WandaVision is that the series finale had a deleted detour sequence that could have been the 10th episode, and it could have worked alongside the main story of the 9th episode, in the same way Episode 4 was simultaneous with the first 3, but there is a petition we can sign to fix that problem. I really hope WandaVision opens up lots of doors for the future of Elizabeth Olsen's acting career, because while I know she is typically an actress for independent films when she is not playing Scarlet Witch, WandaVision showed me her wide range of acting talents for comedy, drama, horror, mystery, romance, and psychological thriller."
5 March 2021,A fantastic show from beginning to end,10.0,At first I didn't know what to think on the first two episodes except enjoyment of a reimagined sitcoms. But then the show began to explain little by little from the third episode and on explaining what Wanda has done. What a great origin story of the Scarlet Witch character! Can't wait to see what the future has in store for Wanda Maximoff in the future of MCU films!
9 March 2021,Great,9.0,"I didn't expect too much from this series. It's the first Marvel's project in this genre, it was like an experiment. And this experiment was awesome. Firstly, the plot is very unusual, first series looks like typical sitcom from the past. Through thd film we can see the development of all characters. Plus, we have some good plot twists. Secondly, the cast is awesome, Elizabeth Olsen stole my heart. Thirdly, the action and visual effects are great, like in MCU films. But it has the problem of Steven King: the final is not so good. So, it's amazing series from MCU."
30 January 2021,Very Good,9.0,"Of all the Marvel projects in the works, this is the one I looked forward to the most. On episode 3 and it has not disappointed. The fact that they went with this format, TV series, over a movie was great for these two overlooked characters.

Don't bother watching if you can't see the increasing less subtle indication under the obviously manufactured veneer that something is very amiss (other than we know they are superheroes Wanda and Vision).

I am a Paul Bettany fan and loving his comedic timing on this project. Can't wait to see him in Frank.

Happy watching!"
15 January 2021,"Starts off really rough, gets very good in ep 4",8.0,"Watching eps 1-3 I had thought the show would start like this each episode as a delusion in Wanda's mind and then back to the real world live and in color. But no, Disney/Marvel went all in on the 50s-70s TV style and the results are lots of mixed and and negative reviews.

One could say that the first 3 episodes each pay homage to a different era in classic TV or perhaps they each just make fun of them. In either case come episode 4 it all starts to get really good and you start to understand why they did what they did and how they did it.

After Episode my rating of the show was a 2/10. That said i still hung in there hoping i was missing something and that if I could hang in there it could get good or maybe just maybe even great. Well I'm very pleased to say I was wrong about my initial review and score and after episode 4 have adjusted both accordingly.

I do believe Disney+ would have been much better off releasing the first four episodes all at once to avoid losing viewers that where as confused and frustrated as I was.

My new score of 8/10 would probably be a 10 if the episodes where longer and if there were going to be more than just 9 in total. With each episode only having about 18m of content and 12min of credits and ""previously on"" that means WandaVision in whole will only be about 2.7 hours long. That means it is basically a feature length movie split over 9 episodes for the sake of having it be a ""mini-series"" or ""TV show""

At any rate unless the show takes another turn after episode four I think we are in for a good ride overall. Try your best not to tune out during ep 1-3 and YES you do need to watch them ep 4 will be meaningless to you without having seen them."
24 March 2021,Masterpiece,10.0,"Amazing and a series that I will always remember, Great job <3 <3 <3"
13 March 2021,Brilliant,10.0,"The attention to detail in the episodes that pay homage to shows from the different decades is top notch (be sure and watch Avengers Assembled: The Making of WandaVision). Heading a top notch MCU cast are Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Kay Dennings, & Randall Park joined by MCU newcomer Teyonah Parris (who will be seen in Captain Marvel 2) and scene stealers Kathryn Hahn and Debra Jo Rupp. The show provides a mixture of emotions that had me in tears during the final episode. Had my doubts when I first heard they were making it, but this show was absolutely brilliant and have me looking forward to more MCU limited run series! Wouldn't be surprised to see Olsen, Bettany and Hahn nominated for an Emmy."
8 March 2021,"Cheesy, fun, and a great entertaining addition to Mcu.",9.0,"4.5 out of 5 stars.

Wandavision is a pretty good first mcu series following on characters like Wanda and Vision after endgame. Now to avoid spoilers about the plot and concept and characters appearances. Is best to see for yourself. Which may surprise some with new faces to the mcu.

What worked with the series? The plot and concept is an interesting mix to the series. Wanda and Vision living in a sitcom like world. Living a normal daily life. While all may not be what it seems. Can not talk more about the plot without giving away twists. The story does dive more into details about Wanda. And her past. And what she may become for the future of mcu.

The cast ensemble worked great. It was fun seeing Elizabeth Olson and Paul Bettany return. Along with Randall Park. And new faces like Teyonah Parris and Kathryn Hahn.

The series does pick up half way through when twists are revealed. And does have a climatic action sequence with villain being revealed and good vs bad happens. Which was pretty cool. The visual effects were not that bad for a tv series.

Wanda discovering more about herself with her abilities is awesome. Which would be exciting to see where the characters can go next for future mcu.

What did not work with the series?

The first half of the series direction is pretty slow and cheesy. With several episodes having that sitcom tone for each decade with each episode. It was fun but cheesy and slow.

Kat Dennings returning as Darcy is still cheesy with annoying dialogue that is supposed to be funny. Her character is still pushed aside in the sidelines for the most part.

Overall, Wandavision is a fun addition. Delivers more depth with the characters. Action and visuals. But cheesy first half of the series."
6 March 2021,"astonishing effect, original story, absolutely amazing sequence",10.0,"Wanda Vision is the first TV series from Marvel Studios I've ever watched. At first, it is coming with huge doubt among Marvel fans I have been asked, because the first episode is a little bit boring, but by time to time, the story is becoming powerful. I can feel myself into the world of Wanda and Vision. These series are having an astonishing effect, original story, and absolutely amazing sequence. The assurance of Marvel Studios as the producer of amazing movies, is eligibly confirmed on this Wanda Vision series. Perhaps these series are the benchmark of the upcoming series and I don't know what is happening for the Season 2. Season 1 is already amazing. I feel optimistic. I really appreciate the hard work of wardrobe and special effect team to make us go travelling into the 1950s situation comedy (sitcom) drama, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and the blurry after it. This is the whole point what we can expect from other Marvel series, especially from Falcon, Hawkeye, and Hulk series that are still on shooting. In this Wanda Vision series, I can not detect imperfect things or sequence unexplained, all causes-effects are so diligently set up, including the appearance and role of the FBI and other surprises scenes. I really love the original story that touch up of Wanda being ordinary mother and Scarlet Witch at the same time. Also I can see the serious thinking of the Director to arrange Episode per Episode to be easily understood by the whole audience, not just Marvel fans. Wanda Vision series is the best opening for Marvel Studios TV series and it is historical starting point of Marvel Studios series package. It is have fun and entertaining, as the TV series should be. It is on your head to make you forget about life, bills, studies, work, etc. So, Wanda Vision is your true friend to make your sweet escape happen."
4 May 2023,Another standout for the MCU,9.0,
25 February 2021,More please,8.0,"Wandavision is INFURIATING due to being episodic. I want MORE.

The throwbacks to old tv shows in each decade has been fun and sweet, and the undertones of nefariousness has been fun to guess between each released episode. I wish the episodes were longer, and I wish I knew which Wanda arc from the comic books they were going with (yes, I'm one of those people.)

Looking forward to seeing what happens for the rest of the season, and I'm totally primed for whatever movie setup they're leading up to like a chump. I'm all in. Keep up the high level production and acting, thanks guys."
25 July 2021,Piece of art,9.0,
23 April 2021,A Great Start to Phase Four,9.0,
17 September 2021,Who is the most powerful Avenger?,10.0,"This series is so incredible! I loved not having a clue of what I was watching at first and I love how delicately Wanda's character was treated throughout the show. She's so powerful and Marvel's pretty consistent in delivering the best, most well-thought production of all time for us to feel everything these brilliant actors can give us. I personally don't remember the comics so well, so I'm not sure if the Scarlet Witch has the same backstory in both comics and cinematic universe, but this show showed us all her traumas, her development as a strong character and was a start for us to understand where her powers come from with a beautiful, raw story about grief. I'm also happy to see they're gonna give Monica some attention in the future. I'm not giving any spoilers, but prepare your tissues before watching this in one sitting (I bet you won't be able to sleep without seeing it through). Brilliant."
16 January 2021,This is going somehere dark.,8.0,
19 May 2023,"A good idea, excellently executed.",10.0,"I'm definitely not the biggest of Marvel, but WandaVision is a delight. Excellent work, especially since Lizzie and Paul are two of the best actors in the franchise, in my opinion.

I love that the series starts without any explanation whatsoever, with a very lighthearted format and beautiful dialogues. If the whole series were like that, it would be enough for me (undoubtedly artistic, and a love letter to sitcoms).

In contrast, they throw in a couple of creepy moments that make you wonder if there's something wrong: weird instants that cut the pace like a knife, mixing all that pleasure of watching innocent acting with a subtle darkness, only to introduce you to an excellent justification of the story.

For me, one of the finest works done by Marvel, along with Loki and Into the Spider-verse."
15 February 2021,Mystical Marvel Masterpiece,10.0,"Absolutely incredible, from the introduction of new heroes to the mysterious happenings in Westview. Everything in this show is entertaining and the sitcom feel makes it more intriguing. This show just keeps getting better and better."
5 March 2021,Simply Wandaful!,9.0,Don't listen to negative reviews. Great script and awesome effects which we come to expect from Marvel. Can't wait for series two!
8 March 2021,Unpopular Opinion,1.0,"Unpopular opinion but this is the worst Marvel thing, done so far. The first few episodes you are wondering what is going on. I feel like unless you are an avid comic readers, most things went right past you. In the end, I don't get how any of this setups Dr. Strange. In the end, I feel like this was all a waste of time."
15 January 2021,"Weird, but I like it",6.0,"As a Brit, I'm not too clued up on the US 50's tv and the first 20 minutes or so were a bit of a slog...but, as soon as the 'weirdness' started to happen I was intrigued. Can't wait to see what happens and thought both leads were superb."
15 January 2021,A Flop Called Wanda,4.0,"This is going to be either love it or hate it, no inbetween. I just finished the wonderful ""Dark"" on Netflix so it had a lot to live up to and failed big time."
10 July 2022,What. A. Show!,8.0,"When this show first released, I thought it would be a romance series only between Wanda and Vision, and I said to myself ""hell nah, I'm not gonna watch this"". But being a bigtime comic nerd, I've always had that urge where I wanna watch every super hero movie/TV show, so I've had this show in my mind everytime I watch a Marvel movie or TV show.

Today, I finally said F it, and pressed play on the first episode, and boy o boy am I glad I did.

It starts of very weird and slow, but then it turns into this long and amazing Marvel ""movie"". I binged the whole series in 1 day. Loved every episode.

Highly recommended, even if Wanda and/or Vision isn't your top 10 super hero from the other Marvel movies."
15 January 2021,First 3 Eps Seem Pointless - They're Not 😊,7.0,I gave this one star and an absolutely stinking review after watching the first two episodes. I just watched episode four and came back to revise my review. Well worth sticking with it.
6 March 2021,Burnt out on Marvel,10.0,"I was burnt out on Marvel for a long time now but I found the idea of a couple of tier 2 Avengers stuck in old sitcoms kinda intriguing so I gave it a shot. What this actually turned into was a whole lot more then I could ever imagine. This is a first rate story of pain, loss and redemption and what Marvel Movie purists don't understand is that it tells an actual storyand doesn't just rely on FX fighting scenes. But I guess that is why they don't like it."
8 March 2021,Idiotic cliches on power dynamics,1.0,"Honestly this TV series manages to be so full of cliches despite the unusual plot, that it's embarrassing. Worst in show: the hyper predictable conflict between the ""minorities squad"" and the evil middle aged white man. Honestly, beyond embarrassing. Not doing society a favour by oversimplifying issues via these crass representations of conflicts and power relations. Idiotic script and writing."
5 March 2021,Great start for MCU Phase 4!,8.0,"I'm a huge Marvel fan but I was only curious about WandaVision mainly because the trailers were just fine. I'm glad, everyone should be glad Marvel takes risks, they don't just make simple superhero movies. WandaVision is great, it's unique!

WandaVision isn't exactly a sitcom, it's a mystery comedy drama. This show pays homage to sitcoms mainly the first three episodes and I personally don't think the first episode is good. The black and white sitcom stuff was another reason why I wasn't excited for this show, The Flintstones, The Jetsons and Scooby Doo were the only 60s shows I seen. I nearly forgot Scooby Doo maybe because it started in 1969. I'm a 90s kid so I didn't feel any nostalgia for the sitcom stuff, maybe a little for the Malcolm in the Middle stuff.

WandaVision is a mystery show so you don't know exactly what's going on, you just know Wanda created her own reality. Weird stuff happens so you gradually learn what's going on. Episode 4 is different, let's just say it takes place in the real world. This show gets less cherry and more serious as it goes along so some moments may feel scary to some fans. I loved the finale in fact it made me glassy eyed.

Overall, WandaVision is a great show! It's not merely a sitcom with Marvel characters. Yes, it's family friendly but maybe kids under 10 shouldn't see it. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany gave their best performances in the MCU. If you're getting tired of the MCU, you may want to give this show a shot since it's unique. If you don't like the first three episodes, you may want to see the next two. I was already excited for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki."
8 February 2021,Incredible,8.0,Incredible performances by both Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany very suspense and has you intrigued Elizabeth needs more roles in marvel movies
19 January 2021,Marvel blended with cheese and canned laughter,4.0,
16 January 2021,First 2 Episodes,8.0,"Come on i didn't watch 12 years of amazing fights, dialogues , good villains, and amazing twists to see this crap, no i don t read comic books i am just a humble fan who speak for himself.

I know what they trying to do with all the mystery and the bad comedy with the fake laughs on top, being wanda she created a loop for her and Vision in the time when the Thanos SNAP took place, but they don t remember anything, somebody try to speak with them maybe give'em some clues and she knows something is fishy couse they don t remember anything from before like the wedding they don t even have wedding rings or they don t remember where they are coming from and what they really are doing there.

It is not what i expected that s why my rating is what it is, but that can change with the next episodes, for me the humor was bad.."
16 January 2021,Pay attention all you 1 star reviewers!!,8.0,
6 March 2021,Style over substance,6.0,"I was looking forward to watching WandaVision mainly to better understand the connection between the two characters. I always felt that I couldn't really appreciate the relationship between the Wanda and Vision as it had had so little screen time in the MCU. So much so, that Visions death in infinity war left me cold rather than the emotional impact it should have had.

In WandaVision I found again that although we're meant to see a couple totally and completely in love - it wasn't there until Ep 9! I just simply didn't believe the 'love story' until then.

The concept was brilliant but for me it was laboured, slow and could have been so much more it could have actually been funny!!! Every episode felt longer than it was. With 25 mins of dull unfunny material followed by 5 minutes of intrigue.

I did enjoy the last 2 episodes, more pace, better writing but that can't save the series for me.

I've still not seen a a Marvel character based series that's delivered in any way close to the movies. I will continue to watch them in the hope they get better with time.

I'll think of WandaVision as the show that could have been but never delivered."
15 January 2021,Unbelievable!,10.0,I just finished watch the first 2 episodes and it's incredible! I literally don't want to spoil anything but it's so worth it to watch. Great addition to the MCU! Some Emmys would be delivered to this magnificent series!
13 March 2021,Genuinely unique and amazing,10.0,
16 January 2021,Best part of the MCU to date!,8.0,"These first 2 episodes were the most fresh, original and creative things the MCU has ever done and for my money, it's the best thing they've ever done"
23 March 2021,Such a creative show,9.0,"The show starts off really weird and confusing, but man does it pay off in my opinion. Really made me wanna rewatch Infinity War and Endgame again."
23 December 2021,A Fantastic First Foray for MCU Disney+ Shows,9.0,"When Marvel and Disney announced their new venture into streaming, high expectations arose and the first show WandaVision has just finished its 9 episode run and here is my review for the show. The premise of the show sees Wanda Maximoff and Vision living in a sitcom like world when they realise all may not be what it seems.

Main Character Elizabeth Olsen has always been good as Wanda Maximoff but here is when she truly shines and becomes one of the real highlights of The MCU. She is charming great to watch in all of the sitcom scenes and it is like she had been doing shows like this her entire life she is so good at it. We learn more about Wanda then ever before and this is a truly fascinating character study, as the show deals with some dramatic elements like grief and loss and Olsen delivers in every scene that she is in.

Supporting Characters Paul Bettany is back as Vision and the two of them have amazing chemistry, Olsen and Bettany are brilliant together and they really get you invested in the show and the premise. Especially for the first few episodes I thought he was the best part of the show and showed a humour that I wasn't sure was possible from him. He also gets plenty of character development and nails every scene that he is in and all the credit has to go to him. Kathryn Hahn plays a neighbour of there's and I thought she really fit into the show nicely, she just seems to revel in the role and like she is having plenty of fun in this sitcom world and that is always cool to see. Teyonah Parris plays a role here and she is really great, we meet her character in an interesting position and as the show progresses she just becomes a really interesting dynamic added and I really liked how much time she was given to shine here. Randall Park and Kat Dennings are back as Jimmy Woo and Darcey Lewis from The Ant-Man and Thor franchises and they are really fun additions. They have some really funny scenes but also have some good serious moments and the dynamic between them and Parris is a real highlight here.

Story This is easily one of the most interesting stories that has ever played out in the MCU, I don't really want to talk about it too much because it takes you on twists and turns you could never expect. It really focuses on its characters and the pain and loss that they have gone through and how the events of previous films affected the show. But I also felt like this show took a little bit of time to get going for me, with it being a weekly release, I felt it wasn't until the end of episode 3 where I got fully invested. Also, although the season final is great, I think people have maybe theorised a bit too much so they might be disappointed, but I thought it was a great finale.

Script The script is fantastic, these characters are just written so well and given plenty of depth and development. The show is funny, dramatic and sweet, it nails all the hallmarks of great writing and keeps you guessing throughout leading to a very satisfying season finale that wraps the show up in a great way.

Style The show's style is fascinating, you see the show transition between a few different sitcom worlds, I thought I would be annoyed by it but no I grew to really like it, especially when it focused on the more modern ones. The episodes are paced well and as the show progresses you see the stakes rise and it feels like it really fits into the MCU.

Overall Overall, this is a fantastic start to the MCU on Disney+. If you are a fan of the MCU then it is a must watch, but even if you aren't I think you should give this a try as it is so unique and one of those shows that will have long lasting effects.

Rating - 9/10."
19 September 2021,Worst series of all time,1.0,I was excited to see this show since I love Elizabeth Olsen and the concept sounded great. I barely made it through the first episode but decided it had to get better. It didnt. I pulled the plug mid-way through Episode 3.
1 February 2021,Best. Miniseries. EVER!!,9.0,
19 January 2021,No idea how to rate this yet (after Eps 1 and 2) - Bonkers!,7.0,"Wandavision is a great idea, but its too early to tell if it is the best tele of 2021 or the worst! I'm willing to give it a few more episodes to find out... certainly Episode 2 was considerably better than Episode 1.

Elizabeth Olsen is fabulous as the sitcom ""wifey""... am slightly more reserved about Paul Bettany, who I don't think is a natural comedian.

Not sure who the audience for this is supposed to be? It should appeal to old gits like me, who remember the 60's shows parodied here, like the Dick van Dyke show and Bewitched. But many might be put off by the Marvel elements. And whether a young Tic-Toc swipe-through generation will stick through the lame sitcom humour is to be seen.

My full review is on my Bob the Movie Man channel on Youtube."
26 January 2021,Label the show with MARVEL and people will come,1.0,"While I enjoyed the show as a throwback to 60's to 70's tv depicting the 1950's

I was shocked by the reviews and ratings and here's why:

It seems like people are reviewing this like they are reviewing a painting where the peer pressure is set to make the meaning and importance where it was n ver meant.

This seems like people are just updating and getting poetic about the shows nuance because it has the monicker of MARVEL. And nothing else

Because if this was really what people wanted, Bewitched, original twilight zone, happy Days, my three sons, etc would be coming back on tv. Except mainstream media and people have Cancelled anything smelling of 1950's

Study of the comments are more interesting than this show"
22 May 2021,I dont get how this has more Than tfatws,7.0,There is not much more to say for me I just don't think this is as entertaining as the later show.
17 January 2021,Sitcom too much,6.0,I initially disliked the show. It was so jarring to see Marvel characters in cheesy sitcom settings. I stopped watching until the series finished. I finished the series after seeing some post-series reviews. I enjoyed the remaining episodes. I'm still not giving more than 6 because of a few points. I still don't find the sitcom thing part of the series particularly engaging even after the full story. It seems that could have been done differently and still maintained a similar storyline. I am also not that big on the secondary witch story. It leaned too heavy on the supernatural.
15 January 2021,Incredible!,10.0,"This show is absolutely incredible! The way the story is told is incredibly unique! Who would've thought a ""superhero sitcom"" would work out as well as this? Marvel clearly knows what they're doing! They've proven themselves time and time again! 10 out of 10!"
29 December 2021,Love it!!,9.0,"I'm a long time marvel fan and know the franchise inside out, but this was certainly something very different. It just missed the 10/10 point due to the first few episodes being dragged on longer than necessary. Although once you sit through them, the show picks up pace and becomes very interesting. Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda maximoff) acts amazingly. Paul Bettany (Vision) and Katheryn Hahn (Agatha Harkness) gave terrific performances."
12 October 2021,So beautifully done,10.0,"So beautifully done and (as usual) so full of (mind-blowing) twists, definitely worth watching!"
9 June 2022,Beautifully Executed!,8.0,"I absolutely loved this show! Not only does it have an amazing, well thought out and creative plot, but it can also make for a fantastic and hilarious sitcom. I definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the MCU."
24 July 2021,A more human approach to galactic powerful powers,8.0,"After losing her brother in Age of Ultron, being forced to kill Vision in Infinity War and subsequently being turned to dust for five years, before coming back and kicking ass in Endgame, the first couple of episodes seem appropriately strange for a lady who's spent her life dealing with loss and still hasn't come to terms with, effectively, being an Infinity Stone powered superhero. Olson and Bettany are great playing the parts of the unconventional couple, living a sitcom life, that has viewers questioning what is going on. There is a lot to unpack and compared to the very brief conversation that Wanda has with Clint at the end of Endgame, this series is like a therapy session for a couple of the most powerful characters in the MCU. It's not the standard MCU format, but that what makes it stands out.

If you're a Marvel fan, you'll probably watch it to move the story forward regardless, in preparation for Phase 4. If you like Olson, Bettany, then you'll enjoy it as they shine through out, especially with support from Dennings, Park and Parris. If you're looking for a post Endgame adventure, then maybe wait till the next Wanda film comes out and see this after if they don't do a good enough job with explaining what's going on."
3 February 2021,You cannot stop watching and leave bad reviews,8.0,"This is a series which develops, it means you have to watch at least 4 episodes to understand why it starts like a 50s sitcom in b&w. So everyone who ended watching it give it another go!"
5 March 2021,A disappointing finale compared with other episodes.,9.0,"But still, WandaVision was really good. It was so entertaining and one of the best things produced by Marvel. It proved that Marvel will go strong as ever after Endgame and their series plans are no joke. Elizabeth Olsen is the very underrated and she stole the whole show and our hearts with ease. More like this please Disney."
16 January 2021,Bad comedy can not watch any more,3.0,I really wanted to like this but it is terrible. The script is not funny nor super hero like. It is a bad parity of 70;s tv shows. I am not willing to give it more than 2 episodes I assume it might get better but no way it can recover to interesting.
29 December 2022,"Well Written, Solid Backstory and a Fun Show",7.0,"This is a mini-series that I checked out since I'm still out to catch up on all the Marvel properties. I wasn't going to watch the shows as it just seemed to be too much. What changed my mind was that while feeding my daughter, who is a newborn, these are easy to put on and follow without taking up too more of my time.

What confused me coming in was that to my understanding, Vision (Paul Bettany) was dead. That is still the case. There is a reason that he is now on this sitcom with his wife, Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen). I like what is behind this, why they are going through different sitcoms through the decades and the larger implications to the Marvel Universe. Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) is a character that I forgot about, but I like how she incorporates back in. She also might now have superpowers herself.

That isn't the only universe pulled in. Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) who works with FBI and we even get a sighting of Dr. Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). This even finally pulls in the X-Men universe with this version of Quicksilver aka Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters). There are Easter Eggs here that were interesting and what the implications are by the end of the run, I'm intrigued to how this one plays in with the movies.

I do think that this is well-made. It didn't need to be the long that it is, but I understand what Disney is doing and getting more people to tune in. The cinematography is good. We get vibes of Pleasantville and I like what why we get the different decades of sitcoms. I should bring up we get a cameo by Debra Jo Rupp, who I love. We also get Kathryn Hahn as a character named Agnes. How she fits was interesting too. I did enjoy my time with this and that's all I ask.

My Rating: 6.5 out of 10."
21 January 2021,Give it a try,10.0,"I didn't know what to expect except that it would different . It is beautifully rendered , immaculately cast and manages to be light and intense at the same time. It echos many of the great shows we grew up with while adding texture and depth. I am pleasantly surprised and thought his was a two off -two episodes and done. While not always accurate on the number of episodes, IMDb shows there at 9 total . I am psyched. We figured we would give it a try and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a pleasant surprise!"
9 March 2021,The show would've been better without Agatha,8.0,
16 March 2021,Wanda watch.,8.0,"I'm going to review this as if its definitely single season show, which looks likely at the moment, so post my review against the main page, rather than against the last episode. I'm going to talk a little about expectation vs. reality in this review but if you're the sort of person just looking for quick notes - I liked this, it's good.

In suburban New Jersey, a town has become locked behind a forcefield. The investigating S.W.O.R.D team, including Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) are confounded to discover that inside, a re-enactment of several classic sitcoms are taking place featuring Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and even more bizarrely, her lover, the now dead synthezoid Vision (Paul Bettany).

I don't think anything I'm going to say in this review is particularly revolutionary. Covid cost us a year of Marvel content and ""Far from Home"" felt like a lifetime ago, so I was very ready for ""Wandavision"" to arrive and just the Marvel logo was enough to give me a charge. The first couple of epsiodes were fine, both parody/homages to classic sitcoms of the 50's such as the ""Dick Van Dyke show"" but with an undercurrent that something was 'wrong' - it begins to pick up from the 3rd episode onwards, when we learn more about life outside of Westview. From there the revelations come thick and fast as the show reveals it's secrets. The performances, particularly from the two leads are great. They've only had a few moments previously to sell us on their relationship, but it's always been done very well and the depths of the losses that Wanda has endured really come to play across the run. The twists, returns and surprises that we got across the run are great and I really hope that we see several of the supporting characters in the show featuring more in the MCU going forward - as seems likely.

A bit of time has passed since the finale now, as I write this review, and I've had a bit of time to think on any . . . underwhelming . . . feelings I might have felt at the conclusion, as certain suggested character cameos or potential plot moments didn't come to fruition. I do have some remaining issues with it, that the ending sold Monica Rambeau a bit short and that Marvel continues to have an issue with characters staying dead, but the idea that I'm disappointed that Reed Richards, for example, doesn't show up is a failing of me, rather than the show.

It was, on the whole, great. Clever, emotional and funny. Roll on ""Falcon and The Winter's Soldier"""
6 February 2021,Coming from a person who hates marvel movies....,10.0,"The series is creatively well done it's superb, yes the first few episodes feel weird or like an i love Lucy sitcom, but that quirkiness and that nostalgia is great! And ties into the plot really well.

Again hater of majority of mainstream marvel movies what more proof do you need? The acting is top notch from the two leads."
1 March 2021,The Big Bang Theory: The WandaVersion.,2.0,
6 April 2021,Brillant,10.0,"This show is brillant and impressive , every single episode is brillant.

Really loved it."
5 February 2021,Bad critics are from casual fans.,10.0,"Don't believe the bad critics. They only expect action. This is a serie on a deeper level. Marvel is creating so much for the future of the MCU with this show.

WandaVision deserves all the hype it's got!"
16 January 2021,This is bad,1.0,"In black and white with terrible jokes and a laughing track?!?! What is this garbage?! Anyone who thinks this is good is clearly inferior cause this is god awful, do not watch this."
6 March 2021,The slowest start to any show I've ever seen.,3.0,"Now that wandavision is over I can say that it was semi-enjoyable. The first two episodes are perhaps the worst television I have ever seen. It was just completely dull and didn't really add anything to the plot or the characters. The show also tries to maintain a comedic tone throughout but it really really does not work and had me cringing at any attempt to make me laugh. As far as visuals go, for a big company such as marvel they were quite lacklustre, the action scenes were bland and cliché because of this and made it lack any stakes or impact. The acting, bruh...it was bad. The twist villain is the worst thing ever since the Incredibles 2...the villain as a whole is the worst thing I've ever seen. The plot was also straight forward, nothing too exciting. This has been quite a negative review but there are positives to the show. I give credit to the show for making me pretty entangled with the characters which made the final episode decently emotional. You could argue that it was carried by previous renditions of the characters, which I actually would agree, but the show took an interesting turn towards the end which was nice. Overall it really isn't that bad, it is a shame that there are so many things that don't work. I am also a firm believer that marvel should have just stuck with making movies which might have swayed my view of the show. I give it a six, interesting to a degree."
9 March 2021,Pathetic. Another mom story,1.0,
23 March 2021,Was awesome.,7.0,
7 February 2021,Marvel does creative stuff now??,9.0,"Alright so 5 episodes in and it's real great and has loads of potential for the entire cinematic universe. The first 2 episodes are pretty boring, things pick up in episode 3 and by 4 and 5 it turns into something amazing. Don't let the episode 1 and 2 deter you from the show. (Honestly you could probably just watch the last 2 mins of episode 1 and 2 and be fine) This show would have greatly benefited from having all the episodes released at once. It made sense for Disney to do the week to week thing for the Mandalorian, but it doesn't work all that great for this show. If you're patient, probably would be best to just binge the season"
7 March 2021,You people are sheep...,5.0,
31 August 2021,Ending ruined it,7.0,"To contradict some of the reviewers here; yes, you can watch this show without knowing what it is about... I did. Going in, I had no clue what the premise was, even though I had seen a little bit of a trailer.

I enjoyed each episode (except the last), and the first episode had me grinning from ear to ear. Even when the big reveal happened, I still enjoyed the series.

Unfortunately, the writers had written themselves into a corner and couldn't figure a way out, so they took the easy/obvious path. I was prepared to give this 9 stars, but the woeful ending ruined it for me."
22 February 2021,NOPE,2.0,"Conjured up from scratch I might understand the attraction but to do this to Wanda and the Vision, nope. Insulting. Comics were better when they had an underground following. Too many mainstream Johnny come lately's now who dont get the tradition. ."
6 March 2021,The final episode of Wandavison had finally come to an end,10.0,
5 March 2021,They really are an unusual couple aren't they?,8.0,"WandaVision is the first in Marvel's line of TV streaming shows. Wanda and Vision haven't been in the spotlight since Age Of Ultron, so a series fully dedicated to these two were very interesting. ""Set three weeks after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Wanda Maximoff and Vision are living an idyllic suburban life in the town of Westview, New Jersey, trying to conceal their true natures. As they begin to enter new decades and encounter television tropes, the couple suspects that things are not as they seem"". I'm a big MCU fan and after Endgame Vision was still pretty much dead so this series bringing him back alive piqued my interest. So is this a great start for MCU TV shows or a big slip up for Marvel?

Firstly, the concept of a Superhero Sitcom with a bit of mystery is such a unique concept for the Superhero genre. Marvel is one of the biggest names nowadays and they make very entertaining movies, but it can feel a bit formulaic. However, WandaVision takes a risk by doing something drastically different and it executes it marvellously. I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of Sitcoms but some great moments gave me quite the chuckle. WandaVision goes through multiple eras of sitcoms from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" to ""Full House"" to ""Malcolm in the Middle"" to ""The Office"" and they replicate it very well. The showrunner knew their Sitcoms and WandaVision conveys this.

Additionally, I love how they use different cameras, different colours and different resolutions for what Sitcom era they are on or changes to a cinematic look for characters outside the Sitcom stuff. There is also clearly a lot of work put into the set design and costumes to replicate these eras as well. Near the last couple of episodes when it goes full Marvel movie there are some great VFX for the action set-pieces as well.

The characters in this series are also all great. Wanda (Elisabeth Olsen) returns and is a lot more on edge compared to the movies. Likewise, Vision (Paul Bettany) was always the cool but slightly awkward Robot guy in the movies but here feels a lot more personality than we have ever seen before. Both Elisabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany did a great job with these characters in the movies but here they genuinely give some of the best performance I've seen in any Marvel project. Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) returns from the Thor movies and is now more than just a side lady who quips a lot but feels more knowledgeable and helpful albeit still very funny. Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) returns from Ant-Man and the Wasp and gets to be more on the heroic side and does some cool stuff. Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) returns from Captain Marvel and is now all grown up and played by a different actor who does a phenomenal job in giving a cool, badass character. Agnes (Kathryn Hahn) is a new supporting character who is very funny as the nosy neighbour with a high libido.

The story is also very engaging with the subtle weirdness that occurs in each episode. I won't go into spoiler territory but there is some great twist in this series. Some emotional moments were very effective in hitting me in the core, especially the last couple of episodes. I also really love that there are adverts that were created specifically for the series that adds another layer to the titular character and the story.

Nonetheless, I have some minor gripes with the series and that it is a very slow burn of a series. It takes quite a while for it to kick into gear in my opinion. The first 3 episodes don't have much happening and it is understandable because the series meant to start more on the sitcom side of things but it does get to points where you're hoping whether something will happen or not. There are also some things in the story near the end that were kind of underwhelming. Without spoiling it is a revelation of a certain character and another character who just appears and then mysteriously disappears for some reason. It just raised a lot of eyebrows in my opinion. Additionally, there is one supporting character I just feel is very weak in terms of character and motives. Tyler Hayward (Josh Stamberg) is the acting director of S.W.O.R.D who just has vague reasons for what he does and I wish they gave more backstory and depth to him because in the end he just feels like an obstacle. After all, the plot needed it to be.

Overall, this is a great start for MCU TV streaming shows. WandaVision does something new with the genre and delivers on it. It also successfully makes us love Wanda and Vision even more. Like most Marvel movies, the ending leads to a lot of interesting possibilities. I thought that Endgame might it for me for the MCU but WandaVision manages to convince me to keep track of the MCU. If this is the quality of Marvel TV shows then I am looking forward to the next one."
19 January 2021,what have they done,1.0,
6 March 2021,Guilty of hastily rating...,8.0,"Yes, I was one of the idiots who rated the show after just 2 episodes! Out of context, those 2 episodes weren't that great, a fault on behalf of Disney for the release schedule I feel. Alas, the show goes from strength to strength and ends brilliantly. Great FX and great story, and kudos for trying something different which, in context (you should binge) is brilliant! One other thing, watch the after credit clips (yes, like in the movies and yes, the credits are far too long)

Can't wait for Falcon/WS and Loki now!"
5 March 2021,What a series!,10.0,I'm kind who likes something new. And here we get WandaVision which was very fresh and different from the other MCU content that I've already watch before. I can't wait for the Multiverse to be more explored in the MCU.
6 March 2021,Awsome show,10.0,The show really keeps its promises... nothing much to say ... its just awsome
4 June 2021,Kind of a waste of time.,2.0,"Having seen the majority of superhero movies, I feel that Disney has missed the mark on their own expectations.

The visual effects Marvel uses are usually pretty great, especially considering the massive budgets they are given. The visual effects did not stand out to me as much in this show though. As someone who loves the actress who portrays Wanda, I would not recommend this show for a couple reasons. Lack of plot development, poor writing and poor character building.

When this show came out, I watched the first episode with excitement. As I watched, I realized the pilot episode does not reflect how the rest of the show would be at all. The pilot episode does not allow the rest of the show to build off of itself, giving the viewer the feeling as if it is pulling information from nowhere. This episode actually prevented me from wanting to finish the series, which is the opposite of the goal.

I finally bit the bullet and watched the whole season. I was very disappointed in this show. It felt like almost nothing was accomplished and the story had really no driving plot. Now some will argue, ""that was the point, it is more of a comedy/parody on classic to modern television"". In that aspect, it was funny at times, but it felt so forced and unnatural that it's hard to gloss over the lack of substance. Wanda did not really grow as a character and instead they give her an overwhelming and unnecessary amount of power.

Not every show needs to have a huge plot, but it needs to at least have one. I will not put blame on the actors for this show though because the actors did a phenomenal job with the poor writing they were given. I won't hate on people for enjoying this show either, this show had some (albeit very little) funny moments. In my opinion though, this served really no purpose to the Marvel universe and the slim amount of funny moments do not outweigh the bad moments.

I would say, if you feel the need to keep up with Marvel media to stay on track, this show is not really necessary. If you feel the need to watch it, you really only would need to watch the last episode or 2.

I cannot advise this show based on the show's quality though. I have hopes they can improve on a second season if they ever have one, but I honestly wish I could take back the time I wasted on it. At least the show is not too long though."
5 March 2021,"Didn't see myself crying, but I did!",7.0,"When the show started, I was very let-down, giving episodes 1-3 5/10. At that point, I didn't see myself crying at this show. That finale was near perfection! Thank you to everyone involved in the creation of WandaVision"
5 March 2021,"Strong start, ending fell flat",5.0,"Time to actually review the whole show instead of... What most anyone else who's posted a review yet has done

The series was clearly more concerned with messing with the audience than telling a compelling story. This may be distract from the fact it's a story everyone saw coming after episode 2. I have no issues with the self contained nature, I have no issue that it doesn't 'flesh out the mcus story.' I take issue with things like how, In retrospect, the big reveals of the series take some big leaps in logic to make work.

The overall story, at the heart of it, is good and develops Wandas character. The performances are brilliant. What it doesn't do, is keep the momentum it builds at the start going."
23 January 2021,i dunno yet,,"3 ep's in, and I see their is plenty to come. But what has been, I am not too impressed. I know they are try to create a psychotic/abstract environment, but it is kinda weak. LEGION was amazing doing exactly that. But this is kinda dull and for a half hour show, moving way too slow. I should know the old shows they are mimicking, but I am finding it difficult. I think watchers under the age of 40 may even not know at all. I am going to stick with the show, but I do find it tedious to watch."
9 February 2021,marvel is back,9.0,A well created sitcom that drastically evolves into a huge Marvel Movie. Many questions to be answered and many more to be asked. With a touch of mystery and thriller like sequences WandaVision sets the stage for the all new phase of Marvel studios productions.
5 March 2021,I watched the whole series,5.0,"Let me start by saying this series is well made, well casted, by all rights it's a home run. I am not disputing that. That being said, I could have just as well not watched this series and been fine. Alot of reviewers are bashing people making negative reviews like they absolutely HAVE to like this show, but it's just not for everyone. If you like it then I am in your corner, I'm glad you liked it, it just wasn't overwhelming, or even whelming for me."
7 March 2021,A Superhero that has movie tropes and a laugh track,9.0,"I don't want to spoil anything for you guys so I won't but I will mention that each episode has a different era of sitcoms and some you might recognize.

Also, the nostalgia rush is criminally high even if you're 33 like me.

The acting is great, this feels like a 6 hour MCU movie, there's new and old characters and the comedy lands very well.

It gets dark (for good reasons) even though this seems like a light-hearted non-canonical story. It's fully canonical and belongs right after EndGame and Spiderman: Far From Home.

You'll appreciate and care for Wanda a lot more since she didn't have much screen time and like I said, some huge surprises that I will hush about.

AND THERE'S 0 POLITICAL FUSS IN THE SHOW. They're finally listening.

MCU is coming back and it's looking good."
6 February 2021,Actually think this is a 9/10 but.....,6.0,We really need to get this show above it's 7.9 rating! It does not deserve that at all! All the people who though it was bad in the beginning have brought the rating down to a place it doesn't deserve to be.
9 May 2022,"WandaVision, Wa-WandaVision! WandaVision!!!",10.0,"This show is so good and pretty funny too, but also has emotional scenes to it. Elizabeth Olsen steals the show with her performance and Paul Bettany did a great job as Vision as always. It also has funny moments, a plot twist to the show and pretty interesting cameos. I totally recommend watching this show on Disney+"
15 January 2021,WandaVision,9.0,"Homage to Classic TV history, WandaVision was a deliciously strange series . I'm very impressed. Elizabeth Olsen has wit ,style and charm in spades. Olson is stunningly gorgeous. Her comedic style was full of suave effervescence. Paul Bettany is doing a creative, humorous, fantastic job. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany deliver the dramatic and comedic goods. Olsen and Bettany play well off each other and sell the comedic factor brilliantly whilst ramping up the melodrama. Expertly produced and spectacularly written.

The show runners took to characters that I was never enamored with and made them some of the best characters in the MCU. I will admit I am not up on the lore but the writers did a great job catering to both comic book enthusiast and pedestrians like my self to keep both mindsets engaged trough the series. WandaVision was incredible and easily the most unique property in the MCU. WandaVision is going to be in the hunt for the Emmy & Golden Globes . I just hope this gets a Blu-ray release so everyone can enjoy WandaVisions splendor. This is wonderful television ."
24 June 2021,Incredibly Unique and Full of Potential- but unfortunately overshadowed by the typical Marvel Schlock,8.0,"What started out as a brilliant and engaging psychological horror-drama, forcibly turned into something bland and generic. I loved this show at the start, its 1950's vibes and its building creeping atmosphere. Elizabeth Olson is fantastic all the way throughout this serious, and truly should earn an emmy for her role throughout. Many people are praising Kathryn Hahn's performance throughout the show, but honestly once they reveal who she truly is, her performance falls rather flat. She also can overact a hilarious amount in the last two episodes, and it's quite horrible to watch. I love the idea and concept of this show, I was so glad how they initially executed it, but sadly its last two episodes take a major downfall. Many people are griping about people simply complaining about the finale of the show, claiming viewers were not satisfied with what they expected to happen- but truly that is not the case- at least for me. When you take something so bound is psychological tendencies, and make it this bland CGI spectacle to finish it off, you truly feel like it loses a lot of its heart and what made it so great to begin with. It feels rushed is what I truly think, and if they had taken the time to think of a more convincing or perhaps more logical ending than my opinion would change drastically. I enjoyed the show for what it was, hiccups and all, but I still feel the undenying thought that if they just made two more episodes before the finale- this show could have been something truly extraordinary. Something I knew from the beginning it had the potential to be.

My Rating: 8.3/10."
10 March 2021,Excellent story with great writing. Marvellous MARVEL,9.0,"Well you just have to bear the starting a little bit apart from that it got me truly and completely.

Surprised, shocked, loved but most of all i cared which it deserved .

I was surprised to sync in so much after the first 3 episodes and the twists and turn will keep you in for a ride ."
15 January 2021,Not a great start for Marvel but surely different and certain to be called Decent.,6.0,"WandaVision (2021) :

Not a great start for Marvel but surely different and certain to be called Decent. I am not a fan of TV series nor i have seen much of it till date but this Marvel series came in watchlist because of MCEU's franchise films. So, WandaVision is as funny as it could be and that's completely different from what we've seen in Marvel till date. Except for this shocking element there's nothing to hype it and no matter how much fanboys exaggerate it, the neutral audience gonna show them the real world. Well, i belong to the neutral club so here i am telling the truth, no hatred, no fanship, no soft corner or anything like that. To be frank and i am not being too harsh but we gotto wait for the upcoming episodes to see where it's heading to? Useless speculations and verdicts are pointsless at the moment. For now enjoy the comedic homage to past sitcoms and wait for the next episodes. The first episode of WandaVision is more humanly funny than the second one whereas the second one has got better humour than the first one. I was bit disappointed with the conclusive parts not being strongly held but thanks to the typical romedy that makes it enjoyable. Overall, a fun ride helped by good performances, old-humourous dialogues and crunchy editing.

RATING - 6/10*

14 February 2021,What a time to be alive,9.0,"Marvel's huge cinematic universe and reservoirs of comic book lore, along with millions of fans hungry for more, have enabled them to produce an amazing TV show the likes of which has maybe never been attempted before. Let's be clear; if you're not already heavily invested in the characters, or are maybe only a very casual fan of the movies, this show will leave you utterly confused and underwhelmed. True, the short runtime and weekly releases don't do it any favors. But if you're patient and have faith in the idea, it's so incredibly rewarding as everything plays out before you. If you're a fan of the movies AND the comics, there are an almost dizzying amount of references and nods crammed into each episode. I'm NOT a comic book person (and you don't need to be), so I get almost equal enjoyment in watching video reviews after each episode that pick everything apart and explain all the stuff that went over my head. More of this type of content, please Disney!"
18 March 2021,"A great show, even by Marvel standards.",10.0,"You start off when watching this show in episode 1 wondering where it's going. I was initially reluctant to watch it because I didn't want to have to sit there and watch some weird 1950s variety show spin off on marvel characters, and was unsure whether it would actually be good. Early on, nobody knew where it was going, but as soon as you get further in the show, it all makes sense. A lot of the content in the later episodes was affected by the current climate, which did sadden me as the ending could have been even better, however at the same I feel as though the show didn't let it get in the way so much that it ended badly, I still loved the show's ending despite some disappointment. I wouldn't let what I've said about the ending put you off, because up until the finale it seems as though the show ran perfectly smoothly, and even the ending was one of the best endings for a show I've seen of recent. Out of all the shows I watched of recent, WandaVision is definitely alongside the likes of the Mandalorian, and I look forward to seeing the Hawk and Winter Soldier soon. 10/10."
17 January 2021,Amazing!,8.0,"People who rate this series with less than 8 stars have a huge problem using their imagination. And besides, they don't know how to enjoy a good sitcom when they see one."
24 May 2021,Great premise but...,6.0,
27 February 2021,I don't get it.,2.0,WTF is this? Gimme a break these are legit reviews.
29 April 2021,Solid entry in the MCU,8.0,"My expectations for this show were pretty high and i wasn't disappointed! Wanda is great. Vision is great. The bad guys are doing a mediocre job but maybe it's just the writing. Sometimes i feel like the whole thing could have been shorter, like, 4 episodes. But overall, i can't really complain. 8/10!"
15 January 2021,What did I just watch?,7.0,
28 February 2021,Love the show and actors,8.0,Love the show but the fake laughs in the background are annoying but I get why it's there.
29 January 2021,Blown away!!!,10.0,"When Marvel announce their slated list of Disney+ shows I imagined the same action packed, heavy effects riddled, superhero show we're used to seeing from them. When I watched the first two episodes I was immediately hooked on the style. As someone who grew up watching shows like I Love Lucy, Bewitched, the Mary Tyler Moore show, etc. with my recently deceased grandma it was a great nostalgic moment but I didn't notice the intrigue and mystery hidden beneath the surface of black and white until my 2nd watch of the first two episodes. Almost every scene hiding some clue as to the mystery and begging the larger question of ""what is the basis of their reality?"". Once I figured that out I couldn't stop looking for clues and when the 3rd episode aired I was beyond floored with the way Marvel took this mystery and made a story that works so well set in famous sitcom styles. Nothing is done purely by accident and the scenes work so well. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are absolutely brilliant in their roles. And seeing PB tackle the humor as a notoriously serious actor has been a joy to watch. I can't wait to find out what they have in store. And for the people that hate what they've done so far and want the action; the budget of the show was $200 million. You'll get your wish soon enough I'm betting haha"
22 January 2021,Just Aweful,1.0,"A show is meant to captivate you into wanting more, I couldn't make it through the first episode without wanting to gouge my eyes out. I hope this gets canned, it doesn't deserve a second season, Love Island would be more entertaining."
11 May 2022,Really exciting show with a bad finale,8.0,
25 January 2021,Unexpectedly good for a Marvel production,7.0,"I'm three episodes in and this show is (a) not at all what I thought it would be and (b) surprisingly different and interesting. On top of that, it is so far not even remotely what one might expect from an MCU production, which are usually mass-produced, generic action comic-book stories with ridiculously over-the-top plots. I'm interested to see where this goes.

Update: now 5 episodes in and it's holding together. I can't tell if it's getting better or getting worse but I'm really interested to see where is going! This is refreshing"
7 March 2021,Finally a Wanda and Vision break!,10.0,"It's time we see different heroes featured on screen. Definitely, Wanda and Vision could deliver. After watching S1, I think Marvel should start considering making more series than movies. Series allows user to connect more with the characters! Way to go Marvel Studios! Can't wait for season 2!!

PS. I didn't read that it was a Series Finale. So, sad."
13 July 2021,Loved it,10.0,"I know Loki is everyone's favourite, but personally, I think WV is still my favourite. Every week I was so excited about the Friday release. I thought the plot was entertainingly, thoughtful, costume reveal was amazing. The mystery was great, storyline understandable.

A tiny note that bugged me is a small technicality: when Billy used his powers, he wasn't saying anything and there was only sometimes a blue glow (in the comics, he had to speak and hear himself to focus his magic). Didn't let this affect the rating, though. It would've been a good opportunity to name drop future characters and such, but not expected."
6 March 2021,MCU series,7.0,"This was a really good first series from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

Asking lots of questions and loving how weird it is, Elizabeth olsen and paul bettany were great as Wanda and Vision.

And awesome fanfare stuff from the comics"
24 January 2021,Creative and funny; give it more than the first episode.,10.0,"Take the bad reviews on this show with a grain of salt. I guess there are those who put Marvel in a box and expect only superhero action shows; and that is fine for them if that is all they want. But this show is extremely creative, funny and a welcome change from the very average tv shows being spit out these days. I love the jump back in time, and the 'usage' of shows from that period; I love guessing which show it is. I'm giving it 9 stars as I've only seen the first 3 episodes. As the series continues I wouldn't be surprised if I come back and change it to 10. Thank you Marvel for taking a risk at something different!"
6 February 2021,I Want to Like This,8.0,I really want to be part of the fun. I want to like it. I want to be excited. I am going to keep at it. Up to 5. Trying hard! A background in MCU would be helpful so I'm studying!
6 March 2021,Great 1st Marvel series from Disney +,10.0,
5 March 2021,The Scarlett Witch,10.0,
5 March 2021,"amazing, amazing, amazing!",9.0,"When I first heard that a new Marvel series with the name WandaVision will be released I didn't expect much. Wanda and Vision both were not one of my favourite characters of the MCU, not even close. Then after the first trailer I was surprised. It looked totally different to the other Marvel films. So then I tought, yeah, this could be interessting and maybe better than I first thought. And then it was released... I liked the first two episodes very much. They were better than I thought they could be and they were weird. The two episodes hyped me to see more of WandaVision and to learn more about what's actually happening. It got from episode to episode better and better. Every episode you learned more about whats going on there and after every episode I was more amazed. After every episode I liked Wanda and Vision more. One of the reasons why is the excellent performance of Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany. And after the 8th episode Wanda was one of my favourite characters. This episode was so important for her character and it was so sad. And with the final the series was perfectly finished.

Well done Marvel Studios, well done."
16 January 2021,Marvel Delivers! Reminiscent Of Classic Television,10.0,"Marvel has once again delivered with WandaVision! This show has many unique elements like the different time periods of the episodes, and it ties into the Avengers storyline we all know and love. Keep your eyes peeled, because there are Easter eggs everywhere!

WandaVision follows Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) in this sitcom world Wanda has created. Each episode varies in style from classic shows like I Love Lucy to The Brady Bunch. While the two superheroes live their urban life, we see glitches in Maximoff's reality bubble. This show will lead into the third installment of the MCU Spider-Man series and a sequel to Dr.Strange. As Wanda (aka Scarlet Witch) opens up the multiverse, Strange is left to clean up her mess.

Kudos to executive producer Kevin Feige for creating a show based on Scarlet Witch and Vision which is so unique but still stays true to its comic book roots. In the comics, Wanda goes mad, and ends up opening the multiverse. In WandaVision, we see this perfect bubble she has created and how it starts to deteriorate. Also true to the books, Vision and Maximoff share twins who also blossom into superheroes themselves, Thomas and William, aka Speed and Wiccan. In the comics, they form a fraction of the new Avengers team. Wanda has her own comic book series which include all of these adventures. Scarlet Witch has always been a role model for me since seeing Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Now that she has her own series, many girls around the world will grow up with her and look up to her just as I did.

The theme of the series is about reminiscing highlights of classic television. In the episodes, the range of classic show styles range from The Brady Bunch to Full House. In this series, we have modern day comedy with the over-the-top acting and era-appropriate wardrobe. At times, it's easy to forget we're watching a Marvel show, and think we're watching an episode of one of our favorite childhood shows. But then there are the strings that pull the viewer back to reality and notice the bigger picture. WandaVision is wonderful for anyone who's an MCU fan or someone who enjoys the nostalgia of sitcom memories.

I give WandaVision 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults. Reviewed by Heather S., KIDS FIRST!"
26 December 2021,A study in grief,8.0,
5 March 2021,Refreshing,9.0,After watching the whole series I have nothing but praise except for not proving my wild theories to be true but I can excuse that :) it's a refreshingly personal series from the MCU and something I hope we see a lot more of. The weekly release was also a nostalgic call back to Friday evenings with the family round the TV followed by an extensive debrief and wild theory crafting every week - this is especially needed during a pandemic. I love Wanda's character even more after watching this series. A beautiful exploration of grief and how we process our emotions. The whole creative team did a fantastic job. I'm looking forward to seeing where this takes us next!
5 February 2021,Finally!!!!!,9.0,"I've been enjoying this show since the start, intriguing and a bit weird. It really got going in episodes 4 and 5 though. Some people on here commenting really need to read up on their MCU and Marvel though! End of episode 5 is amazing!! They are finally in the MCU!!!!!!"
7 February 2021,SUPERMETA - GENIUS - FUNNY - EMOTIONAL - AND MORE,10.0,"If you somehow manage to not like this so far, don't be impatient for big CGI scenes by the time you hit ''Play'' and learn to open your mind. You have to comprehend that this show is in fact a 3+ hour movie - simply split into 20' episodes. You just can't compare it with a show that balances dialogue, exposition and action in every single episode. The first 3 episodes, are merely the first introductory act of a whole storyline, which is a HUGE cornerstone for the very same source material, that brought you all of the ''Avengers''.

Besides, the layers of complexity this show has are so fulfilling, that any need for a third act firework extravaganza is easily surpassed:

The celebration of 50+ years pop TV culture with AMAZING performance assimilation from the actors to match each decade,

The surgically planned details that not only bridge WandaVision with 30+ other Marvel movies and series but also moves them forward,

The absolutely radiant and carefree self-satirizing of our past culture / as well as of the whole genre and character history,

The introduction of just a bit more experimental and eccentric tone into the mainstream, which until now we were used to see mostly in indie films,

The overlooked uniqueness of the plot itself, which would be tremendously more praised for its originality if it wasn't a comic book story,

The self-aware interactiveness with the mind-bending parallels between show content and audience,

And everything else WandaVision ingeniously offers, need no other prerequisites... even if after all of that, the third act will surely include a suspenseful battle, like a cherry on top. Marvel Studios begun as the strongest attribution of comic book material ever on screen, but now it proves itself as a masterful gift of modern Art."
20 March 2021,A really original and different series that gets better and better.,9.0,"I've always been a little apathetic about Marvel films and programs. Some are entertaining and exciting but I was never a 'fan'. But this is different and original. I really enjoyed the premise, the sets and the growing understanding that not all was what it seemed. Enjoyable."
6 May 2022,What a trainwreck,1.0,
15 January 2021,Weird,1.0,"Watched the first episode and thought it was totally weird , no entertainment and a complete waste of time."
18 March 2021,Great,9.0,Fell in love with madness of wanda. Loved every second of the show.
24 January 2022,Mindblowing!,10.0,"It had all emotions!

The pain of wanda at last was depressing it was hard, the whole scarlett witch persona was hyping up and the sitcom thing was perfect! It was a Brilliant and Amazing show!"
21 January 2021,It's ok so far. Not anything special.,7.0,"So after the 2 episode premiere of WandaVision I guess I can say it's ok so far nothing too special or too crazy. Just pretty bland imo.

So let's go through the good of the show which isn't much so far. So one thing I do like is the hidden easter eggs in the episode I won't say what any of them are but, they are cleverly hidden in the episodes. Also I do like the relationship between Wanda and Vision everytime they are on screen you really do care about these two loveable characters and which makes it even more devastating when Vision finally meats his fate in Infinity War.

Ok now for the bad. I really did not like the Sitcom aspect of this show and it's has nothing to do with me disliking Sitcoms. I just don't like that nothing really happens until near the end of episodes which makes it extremely boring. Also it doesn't help that it's not funny at all and more so cringey when they try to get laughs out of you. Another is the credits are so damn long and takes up time that could be spent with character development or I don't know pushing the story forward. Other than that the show really isn't going anywhere I know we are only 2 episodes in but, hay at least it could be a little more exciting or engaging than what we got but, I don't know. I think I am complaining too much. Overall it's a 7.2/10 for me so far.

Update: Ok these last 2 episodes were much better in terms of quality story, character development, and writing. Especially this new episode which connects all the events that happened in the previous 3. Right now after I rated the show a 7.2/10 I'm gonna have to bump it up to a solid 8.1/10."
16 January 2021,"OK, I'm impressed! A brilliantly done homage to TV sitcoms, with a deeper, more dangerous world gradually emerging.",9.0,"Say what you like about the value of Marvel to the greater world of cinema, but they undeniably know how to turn out a well crafted product. I pretty much like them all. That's exactly the first thing that impressed me end-to-end for WandaVision: the production values are Marvel movie-quality and at a completely different level than their TV predecessors like Daredevil, Jessica Jones, even Agents of Shield. Here they've taken two unique characters in the Marvel universe and have given them the development and the center stage that they always deserved, and it's great. There are loads of other superheros with various combinations of strength, speed, super-energy, flight, etc., but Scarlet Witch and Vision stand apart from that pack. It's great to see them getting more attention.

The second big thing is just how far this series travels from beginning to end in just 9 relatively short episodes. Even though there really is just one through-line for the story -- which is Wanda's processing of grief and lost love after all the events in the past four Avengers/CA movies -- by the end of the series it feels like we are in a completely different place than we began. I'm not going to worry too much about giving away spoilers because if you've read anything at all about WandaVision you'll already know the basics. In Episode 1, it's an innocent-looking little homage to the early TV sitcom era complete with the boxy little screen ratio and in black-and-white with just the barest hints of something darker and deeper. But by the end of the final Episode 9, we're fully in the big-scale MCU and Wanda has been transformed into a Major Player in the Marvel mythos. If I have any real complaint, it's along the lines of trying on TOO much material. The series takes on a huge agenda -- episode-by-episode homages to half a dozen different classic sitcoms from different decades; turning two familiar though second-tier MCU characters (Wanda, Vision) into major leads; introducing new characters that we will obviously see more of in future Marvel movies; littering practically every scene with perfectly fitting Easter Eggs for the fans; and managing a complex storyline with twists and turns that keep us guessing and constantly threatens to go off the rails. And if you aren't familiar with the Avengers/Captain America/Captain Marvel/Ant-Man/etc. Backstories, I don't know how you will make sense of any of this. But if you are, then WandaVision is 100% worth it. I given the producers big marks for ambition and for incredible attention to detail.

And I'm amazed by the carefully crafted progression in sheer style from one episode to the next. The actors, most of all Elizabeth Olsen, literally change the way they act to keep up with the decadal changes in sitcom style and presentation. At the beginning we're in the ambience of the Dick Van Dyke Show, and the next week Bewitched, on to Malcolm in the Middle, Family Ties, Modern Family, all with styles of their own. One episode I particularly loved was ""Breaking the Fourth Wall"" which indeed has the key characters talking right to the screen, but in places it veers off beyond that into full-out surreal. And the Finale really does close up all the plot threads while giving us the big-screen Marvel action scenes that really deliver the kick we've been waiting for. Sit back and enjoy. I will just say though that the storyline pulls its usual trick of tossing the baton forward to the next Marvel productions including Doctor Strange 2 and Captain Marvel 2 (no MCU movie has ever been truly stand-alone).

The leads Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen are predictably excellent and play their roles with conviction. I'll say a bit more on the first couple of episodes because those got me immediately hooked: they are uncannily accurate stylistically, and they're brilliant. Wanda and Vision's house in suburbia with the white picket fence. The nosy, brassy neighbor. Vision's day job as an office clerk with the gruff boss. Neighborhood events like social planning teas with the wives and the local 'talent show' fundraiser. The husband (Vision) who's a bit of a bumbling doofus and the more competent wife (Wanda) who subtly gets them out of all their scrapes. There's an undertone of peculiarity and menace lurking just behind the curtain though, and we clearly sense this is headed for bigger, darker territory. Most of all, the charm is in the spot-on behavior of all the roles, both the snappy dialog and the sheer physical movement. Elizabeth Olsen -- who is a very, very good actress - is amazing in these episodes as she is in all of them. She's got every little bit of the early-sitcom ambience down pat. Notice her bright, forward voice and watch the way she's in constant motion, flouncing around the house trading sassy banter with Vision, or merely walking across their living room or front yard with arms and hands held in the PRECISE posture they used to employ back then. (Full disclosure here -- I was a kid back in the heyday of those shows and remember them well.)

I've seen all the MCU movies but for a complex interlocked storyline delivered with high quality and incredible attention to detail, I have to say that WandaVision beats them all. It sets quite a high mark for their next TV series to compete with. Some extra thoughts:"
1 December 2021,Taking a Vision to the Max!,10.0,"My excitement for this show after watching the trailers was justified. Really one of the most, inventive pieces yet devised by MCU creators. The show is intelligent, funny and multilayered. Beyond what many might possibly expect from an MCU spin-off and may be too witty and thoughtful for many viewers.

Hint: if you loved Thor Ragnarok and hated Dark World then give this show a watch."
26 April 2021,"Entertaining, but episodes too short",7.0,"The idea was very unique and different. While the episodes could have been longer with more storylines added, it gave us a good story as to what happened after the Endgame movie and, from what I read, sets up Wanda's storyline for the next Dr. Strange movie and sets up a storyline for the next Captain Marvel movie. All in all it was not bad."
28 February 2021,Best series ever,10.0,
15 January 2021,Insufferable,1.0,"This suffers from the same illness that all Marvel movies suffer from. Total lack of imagination, originality and meaningfull substance. In this case it's Bewitched revisited without any heart or humor. It is just a bland regurgitation of the same old Marvel nonsense."
5 March 2021,A Truly Brilliant Show That Leaves Us Wanting More!,8.0,"WandaVision is a phenomenal show that has gotten better week on week and has delivered 8 weeks of an emotional rollercoaster that ends in a satisfying way and makes us want more. The performances from all are excellent, but Elizabeth Olsen and Kathryn Hahn deserve awards level recognition for me, because they were both superb and Elizabeth Olsen in particular gave this her all and had all emotions on show. The writing and visuals are both standouts as well, this show really has it all and the narrative with the sitcoms was a really nice idea that makes sense as the show goes along. I certainly didn't dislike anything about the show. WandaVisions a great start to a new era for the MCU and I can't wait to see what Falcon and the Winter Soldier brings next

Quote- 'We will say hello again' - Wanda

Rating - 5/5"
5 March 2021,Spellbinding and Emotional,9.0,"A send up to classic sitcoms but at its core a rich and powerful character study for two people who've seldom been given a chance in the MCU, WandaVision is a tour de force and great showcase for Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany who get to bring to life the strangest yet most endearing romance in comic book history all while giving other characters a chance to grow and new talent like Teyonah Paris to shine. I look forward to seeing more from Wanda and Vision in the future and highly suggest this spellbinding series to be watched immediately."
17 January 2021,"Intriguing concept, bold venture.",6.0,"Wandavision is a very intriguing concept, a mix of classical sitcom and MCU shenanigans. The production seems quite a bold venture given how unique the shows premise is for the current climate of television and consumer interests. Wandavision is well produced, however, does seem to still be finding it's feet."
14 March 2021,It gets better but I was ready to switch off,4.0,"I'm sorry but I thought the first six episodes were dreadful, three good episodes isn't enough for it to merit the praise it's getting, Kathryn Hahn was brilliant but I honestly thought it was poor quality, the old sitcoms were funny and that's the difference."
25 February 2021,Elizabeth Olsen is terrific.,7.0,"There are lots of interesting things about season 1. But none better than Elizabeth Olsen. She is terrific. First of all, I think she is gorgeous. And whatever she lacks in physical perfection, she makes up for in stage presence. I wasn't really knocked out by the show. But I couldn't stop watching her.

I thought the changing sets and time periods were entertaining. Along with the comedic commercial breaks. But the story lacked the drama of the Marvel Avengers at first. Although it got more serious towards the later episodes. But still there is this light-hearted sitcom feel to the show.

But Elizabeth Olsen is just a super star in my opinion. She is really the only reason I've kept watching. Although I do like that the episodes are only 30 minutes long. It doesn't take too much time to keep up."
6 March 2021,Unique & Crazy Experience,10.0,
15 January 2021,"So far, so good",8.0,"I don't know what all the other reviewer's problem is, I found it to be quite entertaining. I didn't laugh till I cried but I had a smile on my face throughout both episodes. I wouldn't call myself a Marvel ""fanboy"" and I also don't give everything they do 10 stars, but this wasn't bad at all, and it's just the start. The most intriguing parts about this for most will probably be the mystery aspect and how we ended up here. I'm really excited to see where it is going."
6 March 2021,Surprisingly Good,8.0,
17 April 2021,Pretty average series.,5.0,"Not that great, above 7stars might be paid or disney promoters. It's just keeping legacy of Avengers alive without movies.

It is just Season 1.. still possibility of going up or way, way down (like DC series)."
11 April 2021,the best series i've ever watched,10.0,"When i first heard about a wanda spinoff, i was so excited. Wanda is such a powerful character and elisabeth olsen did the most amazing job. Every episode there was a new turn, a new cliffhanger. Something to keep you on your toes anticipating the newest episode. The ending is just everything!"
16 January 2021,The Truman Show + Pleansantville,1.0,"This show reminds me The Truman Show + Pleansantville + Dark City

Go watch these movies you'll know what I'm talking about.

Actually I'd love to see a real funny Marvel sitcom, that would be hilarious!

But WandaVision isn't a real sitcom right? It's not that funny. If you want to make a good sitcom you need to hire some professional sitcom writers, I guess."
5 March 2021,What a fresh start to the MCU Phase 4,9.0,I was skeptical initially but as i go through the mid season there are more revelation inside. This is where i found the uniqueness of the show and i believe through 2.5 hours format it doesnt work at all. Lastly the finale is mega and possibly more mega than all the ending battle fights in all the past MCU movies. For a TV show 2 pull this off is wonderful achievement. I am looking forward 2 its next series adventure while i will continue 2 extend my Disney + subscriptions beyond 2021.
16 January 2021,"A Disneyfied Ruination of what were 2 Powerful ,Fascinating Characters",1.0,"What happenned? Who on earth though it would be a good idea to take these 2 powerful beings and and put them in some saccharin sweet, gooey, Disneyfied version of the Dick van Dyke show? This was so bad that I couldnt even sit through it, nor could my gf...Yet I see many comments of people heaping praise on the writing and saying they love it...I dont get it....at all. If I wanted to watch old B&W sitcoms I would do it but I dont want to see my mavell favorites in ozzie znd harriet scenerios and I dont understand the people who are saying they are thrilled with this..If this is what Disney's hand in the Marvel universe is going to be like all I can say is that its gonna destroy it utterly and worse than any snap from Thanos....Whats next, Daredevil in a Mayberry scenerio saving a kitty thats up in a tree? Obviously, the wandavision thing is either a projected illusion or an alternate reality but its a boring as watching grass grow...they need to snap out of the illusion and get back to Reality"
17 January 2021,Give it a chance,8.0,"This show is pretty weird and strange. It's totally unlike anything in the MCU. Don't expect there to be big CGI battles and action. It's a comedy that takes inspiration from old sitcoms. Episode 1 in particular is a homage to sitcoms of the 50s such as ""I Love Lucy"". It's really funny in a unique way as it's got that campy sitcom vibe to it, but the two leads played by Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olson are really fun. And the show has a few creepy moments to show that clearly something is wrong. We just have to watch and find out. There are only 2 episodes out thus far so many people are writing it iff as trash. It's really not though, and I think people need to fully watch it to make their own opinions on it."
15 January 2021,omg this is really bad,1.0,"I dont really understand the great rating, how could you?"
16 January 2021,- We experienced this program -,8.0,"I'm a huge MCU nerd but i gotta admit that this was rather boring at first, especially the first 3 episodes. Glad the first ep was short. Maybe it's because i haven't seen many 50's shows, but it kinda felt like it was forced. Despite that, the first trio episodes were tolerable drama. Always hated the laugh tracks but this sure made it even more hateful. Regardless of that, great performances, Marvel Studios Intro, loved those. Hey, but strap in, it gets better after each episodes. Ep.4 - ep-9 is what i call MCU supremacy."
6 April 2021,Pathetic excuse for a series!,1.0,"Stupid, irritating and humourless. Who are they really trying to appeal with lame, campy, black & white style sitcoms? They could have created a far better series with Wanda & Vision, but this was their end result? Truly pathetic."
5 March 2021,Perfect,10.0,"At the firsts three episodes, the rhythm is slow. After that, it gives clues for a million theories about what's going on and it's incredible. Finally, a gleam for this powerful character, that has grown so much since the Age of Ultron. The implicit references, a classic move from Marvel, makes fans goes crazy, just like The return of old characters and the addition of new characters and elements from the comics. Elizabeth acting like Wanda is magnificent. The visual effects, costumes, scenarios are just perfect. My congratulations to Marvel, a wonderful connection for Doctor Strange 2 (I can't wait for more of Scarlet Witch)."
17 February 2021,"Ok, the first episodes really suck, but...",9.0,...it gets better and better. And no spoilers will follow. Just watch it. ;)
9 March 2021,So you're saying the universe created a sitcom starring two Avengers?,8.0,"On friday, the last episode of ""WandaVision"" was released and it was amazing! The whole show is an adventure, an fascinating, thrilling story that achieves the same effect on people who have never seen Marvel before like on long-time fans. It is great that the show doesn´t clarify right away the mysterious things that are happening in Westview. That gives the viewer space to develop own theories, he muses about it more and looks forward to the next episode. ""WandaVision"" has set it´s own tone; the combination of sitcom and superheroes, old TV-shows and reality is new, funny, lively and exciting. Thanks for creating such a special story!"
7 March 2021,Completely baffled by the high Rating,4.0,"Unsure how or why that this series is rated this high. Episodes are short, each about 30-40 mins or less after all the credit sequences. First few episodes were dreadfully boring and doesn't create any interest at all. It was so boring that I even nod off few times in that 30 mins.

Last episodes are little better because story actually starts to progress. This could have been a 3-4 episode series easily. If that. I'm not sure how this series is getting this high rating in this time of the day where there are so many good series in multiple different streaming platforms. Rating this series this high is setting the bar low for others."
15 January 2021,A callback to the black and white days with a few twists and turns along the way.,8.0,
17 January 2021,Terrible,1.0,"This series overhyped garbage! Disney/Marvel have tried very hard to be clever and creative, instead they've just failed miserably at it. The first episode was really annoying and unfunny. The second episode was even worse. Don't waste your time folks!"
27 March 2021,Fantastic series,8.0,"Builds up slowly over the first few eps and then it gets really good. Wonderful effects, great acting and sets with a fantastic storyline."
23 February 2021,Taking The Leap to be different and it works,9.0,"This is such a different type of MCU it's freaky. And it works. I knew Paul Bettany could act, but I really surprised and estatic that Elizabeth Olsen has shown some serious thespian chops! Kudos to the Marvel creative team that put this show together and in keeping it tight. This ia an very impressive start to the next round in the MCU. Excelsior!!!"
19 February 2021,This show makes my brain itch.,2.0,"I tried to like this show overlooking the dreadful sitcoms references, the lack of coherent storytelling. I kept thinking this is all going to pay off. Guess what I felt like I was in my college level algebra class...and honey I was truly lost in that class.This show is a complete and total failure with lame characters and plots. What was Marvel thinking when they put out this trash. I tried to like it but all I got from it was a itchy brain."
11 October 2021,Ugh,5.0,"Not good at all. Some ok parts but the first 2 EPs are complete write off, the last 2 are a cgi mess of people flying and pointing hands at each other . Lazy choreography resulting in a meh finale. These marvel series are really dragging down the quality of the movies when you have to factor these as being connected. Would say this was worse then agents of shield."
5 March 2021,"We just don't know what to expect, but its astounding non the less.",8.0,"Coming from a 2 year drought with no marvel content. To come out swinging with their first tv-show, and actually manage to hit a home run, is absolutely amazing.

I must say I was skeptical when the show first aired, but intrigued by the mystery surrounding it, as we all knew they had something up their sleeves, and I must say for each episode they raised the audiences expectations, improved plot lines and caught us up to speed with everything that's happened since Infinity war and Endgame, and I actually grew so fond of some of the episodes that its sad to see their individual style not returning for a season 2.

Each episode with a new and interesting plot line with a twist of ""sit com style television"" with small hints and nods through especially the first couple of episodes, whereas it later evolves into the more usual stuff that marvel is known for, but I'm glad that they stuck with the sit com format for the majority of the episodes. It changed the whole atmosphere of the MCU, and changed the way we interpret these superhero movies.

It's clever that after 23 of films, they still manage to find something new and interesting to spark new joy and twists into the franchise and also connect everything together and make you even more excited for the next movie or show on the horizon.

They definitely touch on topics that hit you right in the feels, which I was quite surprised about actually. I was not excepting it to be as deep and interconnected, as it was, but just a cash grab and a quick fix to start out the next phase. I'm glad to say this was not the case, but they really spent some money and pour their souls into making it work. Now that the show has ended I'm honestly going to miss waking up every Friday to watch a new episode of Wandavision.

Marvel took a chance with Wandavision and they succeed big time. They evolved the creativity of television and the MCU as a whole, expanding on the already large array of movies, and now TV-shows, and this is just the beginning - An amazing official start to phase 4 of the MCU! I can't wait to see where they go next!

9/10"
3 February 2021,Glad the whiny people dropped off after 3...cause episode 4 is above them.,10.0,"So now that all the impatient people with over-dramatic low reviews are gone, the pay off is evolving very nicely and I am not sorry their snobbery is missing it.

This is exciting TV and the gamble was big and establishment was brazen and fun. Darcy Lewis brought on some great happiness. Great job Disney."
12 March 2021,1star reviews need to chill.,10.0,I'm not a fan of marvel but I gotta say the one star reviews need's chill because there's nothing wrong with this show yes I will agree the first episode was a little bad but it get's better and better as the show progresses and ofcourse the cgi is perfect.Just watch the show till the end than review it please don't hate the show cause of the first episode nor the second just finish the show.
9 March 2021,"Not good, not terrible... but kinda terrible",4.0,
23 January 2021,Wanda and vision is a remarkable series,10.0,
15 January 2021,Dreadful,1.0,Screechy and obnoxious. Not creepy. Not funny. Atrocious garbage.
9 March 2021,Why do they try to cram so much into so few episodes?,,"Why do ALL of the Disney+ tentpole shows like Wandavision and The Mandalorian have to be limited to less than 10 episodes a year? They could have easily expanded Wandavision out to 12-14 episodes and easily fit every good story concept they had to drop due to time. The first three ""sitcom only"" episodes really wasted a lot of time by only hinting at what was going on, without moving the story forward.

Finally, episode four shows what's really going on and we get to start watching a real MCU story. After that, they apparently had to cram the story into only six more episodes. all to keep it under the 10 precious episode count, On top of that, Disney+ is the only service that keeps shows like this to around 30 minutes.

Don't get me wrong, the story is fantastic, the effects are great, the characters, given the time they had, are well developed. But the short run and short episodes are aggravating. Network shows still have 16-24 episodes, year in and year out, even though they do have commercials. Meanwhile, streaming services like Disney+, Netflix, Hulu and Prime thinks that eight episodes every year or two are good enough."
8 March 2021,Clever and Entertaining,8.0,
8 March 2021,It's okay,7.0,"The tv show is fine, although for my taste the parody they do seemed too long to me, they could have done something else if it had been shorter. In summary is good."
16 January 2021,I need longer episodes!,9.0,This show was amazing Elizabeth Olsen is outstanding I cannot believe the nostalgia and Easter eggs throughout this entire series I have such high hopes.
21 March 2021,Give it a few episodes,9.0,"I know that saying is normally for bad shows, but just give it a few episodes. It's just got a bit of a slow start that makes sense once you're a few episodes in."
18 August 2021,I would say brilliant,9.0,Just stay with it and you won't regret it. You just need to cope up with first 2 episodes. And this is seriously brilliant work out there.
15 January 2021,Uninspired,2.0,
14 March 2021,Wow what a concept of rolling,10.0,"I was a bit septical at first due to black and white and then man it grew on me very very fast. Felt like a drive through the memory lane; on an old road with a new car, just waiting to pit the pedal to the metal.

Enjoyed it very much, and was looking forward to revelation, but when everything started to fall in place and the era came, felt like man it was awesome when it starts from 70s,80s,90's,00s.

Excellent start hope it can keep up in the next season.

Kudos Marvel for showing an absolute new style of introduction and concept of beginning. Loved it."
29 January 2021,A Masterpiece In It's Own Way,10.0,"WandaVision has taken the Marvel MCU to the next level. Although some Marvel fans say they don't want to waste their time with this ""boring show."" I think the exact opposite... WandaVision has brought back the nostalgia of old sitcoms. Not only have they brought back nostalgia but they have also managed to incorporate one of Marvel's biggest strengths, which is keeping you on the edge of you seat and wanting more. Every episode leaves you speechless and wondering what will happen next.

Although this shows first 3 episodes haven't been filled with action from start to finish, they have created a spectacular TV series with incredible acting that dives deep into the world of WandaVision.

By the looks of it I can see that there will be a lot more action coming out way in the near future with this show. So don't wait and start watching now!"
15 January 2021,So good so far!!,10.0,"WandaVision perfectly captures the nostalgia of classic television while still telling a MCU story. In just the first two episodes we saw Wanda and vision in a typical sitcom, with subtle hints of what's to come and why they are in a television show. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany give award winning performances and I can only assume they get better. Kathryn Hahn give a fun supporting performance that I have some theories about. So excited for the next episodes."
12 March 2021,Ep 4 doesn't matter its not that good,2.0,"I for one hated the quirky take. Ep 1-3 add nothing to the mystery, they are just weird. Just because you aren't sure what is going on doesn't make it interesting. Marvel is trying too hard to protect the movie franchise with this series....i hope the f/ws series are better and Loki"
6 February 2021,You're in for a surprise,8.0,"I don't know how Matt Shakman convinced Disney to allow him to make three dedicated episodes of vintage comedy TV before actually diving into the plot of the show, but it WORKS. Obviously the acting is fantastic, and the first episodes give you JUST enough of an uneasy feeling to be curious enough to keep watching. It's worth it. This is a weird, refreshing show. The only downside is that they have to keep it PG - this show would really benefit from a contrast with some serious violence."
28 January 2021,"It's not Television, it's Wandavision",8.0,"The show brilliantly uses American sitcoms to symbolize the impossible fantasy of a perfect life. But reality threatens to spoil the perfection. Each episode captures a different era of a stylized romantic comedy, perfectly dressed and filmed to fit its TV era. And each episode forces Wanda and Vision forward through time towards an inevitable heartbreak, and their own endgame."
5 March 2021,Visionary Tv series,10.0,
22 January 2021,All becomes clearer in Ep 3,8.0,"Stick with it, becomes a little more clearer in episode 3. I'm a massive marvel fan and have to say I'm a little disappointed in the first 2 episodes, very slow, and the canned laughter is so irritating. I can see it's starting to pick up now after watching ep 3, we're now in colour and gone from 4:3 to 16:9.

I will be sticking with it as it is getting better."
10 March 2021,Great first marvel show to start them off,10.0,Wanda vision is an amazing show with lots of mystery and suspense. This show has amazing actors with awesome plot line with no holes. This show was really fantastic for everyone.
6 March 2021,Great offical start to Phase 4,,Its a very intresting show. Would recommend as it sets up doctor strange 2 and captain marvel to an extent
22 March 2021,Great start for the marvel tv show,9.0,Overall a great miniseries a mixture of today's parody pop culture tv and Wanda and vision chemistry was amazing
15 January 2021,THE FIRST THREE EPISODES WERE SO GREAT AND AMAZING,10.0,I'm glad that I have a critic brother and we both watched WandaVision first three episodes early! And it was absolutely amazing and incredible. You guys are in for a RIDE!
16 February 2021,It's different in a way that it's well played out.,7.0,The series wants you to think multiple scenarios but it tricks you into something it's not. The use of making a superhero sitcom was amazing and I believe it could bring alot of attention to others to contribute into making films or series like WandaVision
21 February 2022,Amazing,10.0,"OMG, this show is amazing, why is everyone saying the first two episodes are bad, they are not that bad. I like the black and white! Please make another season disney!!"
9 May 2021,"Very good, nostalgic, builds mystery but doesn't quite perfect the landing",8.0,
21 June 2022,Useless sitcom!,1.0,"Apart from the last 2 episodes, the show was really horrible and so boring, hopefully there will be no second season!, it was painful to finish this one!"
5 March 2021,Honest review,4.0,"After seeing the season through the genuine feeling is the show teases a lot, but delivers very little substance. Feels like a 1.5 hr movie stretched into 4.5 hrs which is then chopped and stretched for 9 weeks with each episodes run time taken up with 10 minute ending credits. Just a desperate attempt from disney to stop people from cancelling their subscription for a streaming platform with nothing new to offer. If this is dinseys new direction dripfeeding content 30 minutes a week it doesn't justify the cost of subscription to me. They rely on the brand of marvel, yet now using it's weakest content."
16 January 2021,Only 2 episodes in but.....,5.0,"An example of art and style over content, the makers have gone to huge lengths to recreate a 60's sitcom, albeit a pretty dull one, and hoped that adding the Marvel name and some super powers created an interesting show, no it got dull pretty quickly. Once I got past the great art direction and 60's style (Wanda in particular is perfect) I got bored waiting for it to go somewhere.

It doesn't, if they are trying to build a mysterious plot it's taking too long, a brave idea with plenty of resources thrown at it but once the 'difference' factor wear off, it starts to grind. I might look at the next episode but probably not, also the episodes are really short with nearly 10 minutes of titles, silly."
7 May 2023,"A Slow Start, A Disappointing End",6.0,"The story in WandaVision starts off slow and strange, but gradually improves until the introduction of Agatha Harkness, which ruins the whole plot. The unnecessary twist spoils the show, and the first 90 minutes are mostly filler material. The actors do well, but the show is badly written and lacks a satisfying finale. While a few episodes are enjoyable, the rest feel like a waste of time. The sitcom elements aren't funny, and the mystery isn't compelling. The concept has potential, but the execution falls short. The special effects are good, but not enough to save the show. It's a shame that such a talented cast was given a weak script. Overall, WandaVision is a mediocre and overrated show that fails to impress. The premise is intriguing, but the execution is lacking, and the humor and serious elements don't blend well. The show is a missed opportunity and could have been much better with stronger writing and pacing."
13 December 2021,Phenomenal,10.0,
7 March 2021,Stunning,9.0,"Watching this series was a different experience. In first three episodes, you can't get what is going on but after fourth episode everything starts getting clear slowly slowly. Many people are complaining that first three episodes are bad but I think just showing action in ghe starting would have made this just normal show. I loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes. Fourth episode justifies the use of the first three and even gave some answers to the many questions.

Overall, a great show. And no one should judge this (or any other show) on the basis of first three episodes."
29 January 2023,Maybe 2 out of 9 episodes were interesting...,4.0,"Started watching this and thought ""what the...?"".

It was unbearable and seemingly pointless for many episodes. I had to FF>> thru a lot of it assuming all 9 episodes would be goofy parodies of old TV shows.

Then when I realized the point of it all, I was still in a nose dive. I recovered a little bit, but not much.

I have a problem getting thru these Marvel movies any more. SOOOOO predictable. I praise Jesus for my fast forward button. If anyone remembers old TV shows from the 70s, the ending would always be a wrap up, basically a time-waster, to conclude the episode. That's how I feel these Marvel movies are.

You know how it's going to end. And you feel like you're just wasting time until it completes. It has a bunch of mindless fight scenes.

There were a couple cool things in this series, but for the most part it was horrible. Kudos to attempting something interesting, but a total miss."
15 January 2021,Terrible,1.0,I tried i really did so far its not good im giving it a one to balance things out 9.3 not on my watch I see you fanboys giving it a 10 already
13 February 2022,Unique and Wonderful,10.0,
2 April 2021,Good but not wow,7.0,"Ok, so it had a very slow start, till E 4 when nothings started rolling and got interesting. It was good, but not wow as many of the reviews, as for the ending, was expecting it to be different and better instead of a silly girl fight."
27 January 2021,Weird but great,8.0,Weird but great show. Great to see Marvel doing something different for a change rather than the same old boring stuff. Can see this will get more interesting as each episode comes out
16 March 2021,"Awesome series,but little bit clumsy in the end.But stilltill it is just a beginning",8.0,What a brilliant series full of twists and mischief's many many blah blah blahh. I never expected it would end like this but anyway . Their is many questions and answers remains. we still have to wait.
7 March 2021,Incredible acting,8.0,"Both Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany show there incredible acting skills in this series, both deserving of an Emmy. And I hope to see a Scarlet Witch movie later on"
27 January 2021,Really?,1.0,Watched 2 minutes couldn't stand anymore What The hell is this all about
18 March 2021,Pretty cool,9.0,A great start to the MCU shows. The different time periods for tv shows was a great idea. You really get to explore each character more in this show.
14 March 2021,Big mess,6.0,"I kinda liked first episodes even more than the last lones. There was no action, but atleast it was not that messy. So much random stuff happened.... I really like marvel but if i have to compare to other Marvel movies this was one of the worst for me. Production budget feels pretty huge and vfx is not terrible, could be better. Problem is the script... Anyway, still better than Arrow/flash etc. Cheap shows."
17 January 2021,Such a unique series,10.0,"I've never watched any series like this in my life, and I really liked how unique this show was. I love both Wanda and Vision, and since the episodes are really short it's a series that I would like to recommend to everyone!! Also, gives so much ""That 70's Show"" vibes!!"
2 May 2022,WOAH,10.0,"To keep it short: It was da bomb.

After watching the series six times, it is still one of my favourite Marvel series (although Moonknight has to share this rank). Perfect actresses and actors, the storyline was great (ok, at some parts it could have been better) but all in all it is WANDA-ful and it is actually a bit sad that Wandavision did not get any Emmys for the performance of the actors.

To sum it up: It is a masterpiece!"
4 August 2021,"Pretty good, could be better",7.0,"Having seen the entire series I can say that Wandavision has some great Episodes, some awful ones and some incredible ones as well. Episode 8, is one of the best episodes of TV I have ever seen. The Mockumentary one, is one of the worst. The main problem here is that I found myself liking the Pleasentville, Truman Show, Fallout vibe of episodes one and two. So when they moved form the 50s/60s into the 70s I felt that the overall vibe of the decade made less sense. The show can get lost in it's own formula and format. The documentary episode or ""Office"" is just terrible. It's awful. I think one sitcom episode less and the show would've been perfect. I loved the design of Vision at the end. Wanda's character moved well, though Agatha wasn't a great villain. Hayward felt like a missed opportunity, they should've done more with him. Spectrum deserved her own show, here she feels very tacked on. I would've paid good money to watch a Monica Rambau TV series. Randall Park is funny, but Woo falls a little flat.

It's completely solid, and I appreciate how it breaks the mold. I just wish it either broke it even more or not all. It feels like it want's to be different but has to revert back into he MCU formula."
23 January 2021,"Slow build, but excellent",9.0,"It is a little slow developing, but for those that are patient you will be rewarded. If you have some knowledge of the source material, you are probably loving all the Easter Eggs. For those that are not familiar with what is happening, hang in there, it will be worth the wait."
15 January 2021,Remember there's 9 episodes,10.0,You all are reviewing the show 2 episodes in! It is supposed to be very cheesy she's in a sitcom basically. There are also 9 episodes . The show is just getting started. It's just the beginning just wait! The later episodes will be action packed
15 January 2021,Will keep watching,10.0,I know why they have started the way they have. I know wanda has created this universe so that she can be together with Vison. Her reality will slow start to falter. I will keep watching to see how it all unfolds. But the first two episodes were hard to get through.
19 March 2021,perfect,10.0,This show may have had a slow start but was definitely one of the more unique things to ever come out of the MCU. It was pretty experimental and definitely worth it in the end. The people who are disappointed are those who focused on all the random theories that were going on instead of just purely enjoying the show for what it was. There are a few unanswered questions but it's not like this is the end of Wanda's story since we will see her in Multiverse of Madness and possibly the next Spiderman film.
26 July 2022,THE BEST MCU SHOW EVER,10.0,"OK THE STORY, CHARACTERS, AND HOW THE STORY UNVEILED WAS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. The entire cast worked extremely hard and they delivered. Don't have anything else to say. Also the duo of Agatha and Wanda is the best MCU has ever seen."
3 October 2021,"Drama, Comedy, Action, Thriller, Romantic...Everything you need in a series is here...",8.0,Must watch Series for a marvel fan...connects Endgame to Multiverse....
15 January 2021,Boring,1.0,Marvel is becoming very overrated. this is horrendous
20 March 2021,wandavision,7.0,"A really fun series that I enjoyed watching, but the first and last episodes were the weakest in the series, but it was still an excellent series, the series had some annoying errors such as not answering some of my questions, and the acting and story in the series was the best in the MCU, my rating for this series is 7.8"
15 January 2021,Boring sitcom,1.0,"Not a single joke landed in the first episode.

If not for the laugh track, i genuinely would never assume most meant to be jokes."
15 February 2021,WOW,10.0,"This show has a slow build but it's worth it! I've never been this blown away with a show before. Also, I LOVE that they brought Darcy (Kat Dennings) back! Everyone is phenomenal! Well done, Marvel!"
17 January 2021,I think i skip this one but it seems That I am not skipping this,8.0,"I am 2 episodes in and all I can say this show its not for me I just feel booerd watching this I tried Hard to keep watching the show but I just could not I was on my phone insted watching youtube. I dont understand People rating this a 10 really? Its not close to a 10 I give it a 5 just beacuse the production its good. I dont feel Marvel is a sitcom brand but that how I feel.

Update: ok the show is Great now i Was wrong."
10 April 2021,Gets better and better....,8.0,Don't give up on the first episode! It all comes together and is a great addition to the Marvel family!
17 January 2021,"Everyone says ""you need to watch closely"", better yet, just don't watch",2.0,"Boring and dry. I understand what they are going for, but seems like just using MCU to draw fans to a bad series."
15 January 2021,An insult to the intelligence of any generation,1.0,"An American sitcom revival Why! Why!....... what was was good in the fifties and sixties, was the original scripts and the popularity of Lucille Ball and Co. nothing original here in 2021...what was Marvel thinking?

Oh wait a minute, it's Disney executive's nostalgia...without the ads...."
13 March 2021,Innovative but ultimately boring,7.0,"I get the idea is very interesting and innovative, good for Marvel to come up with this. The execution though was somewhat missing. Relying on sitcoms format throughout 80% of the season really dragged on and the plot was not compelling enough to give it my full attention. I was bored with most of the sitcoms and wanted to keep watching to see just the conclusion of the show. Also, after we learned what was happening in episode 4, it was rather pointless to continue dragging the oblivion sitcom blackhole."
12 March 2021,One of the best and most creative things Marvel has done,9.0,
15 January 2021,"Well, what was this?",9.0,After 2 Shows its just boring. Hope it gets better soon
9 May 2021,What a powerful mini series!,9.0,I was reluctant to watch this when I first saw the trailers being that the superhero stories have gotten a little stale to me. I was so glad I finally did. This mini series put a great new spin on the superhero genre and took it into a new dimension. The acting was on point the main characters were so likeable and story was so orginal. It will have you wondering what the hell is going on for the first few episodes and when you do figure it out you'll enjoy the rest of the ride.
21 February 2021,So far so good,8.0,"I like this better than Luke Cage, The Defenders, and The Punisher. It's an interesting storyline, a few twists and turns. I think most people will enjoy this over some other Marvel TV shows."
1 April 2021,Marvel takes us to places we never thought would be possible,8.0,"I am not a hardcore comic book fan, not as much as i watch the movies, I am just an average reader but I have read House of M, a very good book and i never thought ther would be a time where marvel will adapt it in the MCU. The show is mysterious probably the main reason why i was glued to it, each episode answers a question by leaving dozens of questions, Elizabeth with a phenomenal performance. Wanda and Vision are my new favorite couple. And Oh, watch out for episode 8!"
10 February 2022,Passion,,
17 April 2021,Wow. So clever. So fresh. So original,9.0,
11 July 2022,Simply Amazing,9.0,"I don't know whether to give it a 9 or a full 10 . This was arguably ""one of the"" Best MCU shows in History .

Each episode was better than the Last . The Humor was for once needed and Great . And really Good . The Show itself was Very Confusing and Mysterious.

The First Episode was Really Confusing . The Plot Made sense after episode 4 . And the Full Circle at Episode 8 was Awesome. Episode 8 was the Best One . And Episode 9 The Finale was the Second Best .

I didn't know what to expect as I had no idea what was happening . I had a brief thought it could be House of M like storyline but Wanda had never displayed Reality Warping powers . So this was a surprise .

I really liked what they did here . The Best Start off for Phase 4 .

The only reason I didn't give it a Full 10 was the obvious disappointing Ralph Boner Joke .

The tease was amazing but the reveal kinda ruined the mood a bit . But the ending the costume and the post credits . Set up a lot .

Overall One of The Best Shows in MCU and Even Overall other Fandom Shows History ."
27 March 2021,A must watch series,9.0,
7 March 2021,Awesome,8.0,Paul bettany was grear. story was fresh and fabulous.Direction was really good.
3 March 2021,No need to know all about the MU to enjoy this,8.0,"I am not a MU fanatic. Yes, I've seen the movies, but I didn't watch any of the TV shows or read the comic books. And, while it is probably advantageous to know all of the backstories of the characters, I have thoroughly enjoyed the 8 episodes of WandaVision very much! This is a very interesting and very good show. Like others have said, it took a bit of determination to get through the first few episodes, but sticking with it really paid off. A show is good for many reasons, and WandaVision has all of them. For those who are skeptical about watching, all I can say is that it is totally worth watching. This show is as good as anything else ""new"" right now. You'll thank me for it later."
29 January 2021,Marvelous!,8.0,"Based on the 3 episode I watched by far, this is what I call Art. Acting couldn't be better, the story is just mind blowing. I'm speechless so far."
27 February 2021,Love it.,10.0,"Amazing , fanatic , masterpiece.I have watched 8 episodes of this tv series. I liked this TV series very much. This is marvel's best tv series. It is a lot of fun watching this tv series."
28 May 2021,Unique Show that Ends In Typical Marvel,7.0,"After the first 7 episodes, I was hooked to this series. Every episode it had me hanging at the edge of my chair. I looked forward to new episodes, but when episode 9 came, it was just like any MCU project, which is a shame, because this series was so unique, and it was one of my favorite things in the MCU. It would be a nine, but I will give it an eight."
25 March 2021,Its Wanda's Time to Shine...,7.0,"Wanda Maximoff & Vision were two of those characters in MCU who had a lot of potential but never got the character development they deserved. But finally with this show, Wanda who is probably the most tragic character of MCU, finally deals with all her grief & loss. Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal as Wanda, imitating characters from different era tv shows & constantly balancing the line between Good & Evil. Paul Bettany is great as always & their Chemistry & Love really establish WandaVision as the Best MCU Couple. The rest of the Cast was good too but the final episode was kind of a letdown. The sitcom style episodes were a lot of fun & unsettling as well. Looking forward to the rest of the Marvel shows."
29 September 2021,Fun and Intriguing Dragged Down by an Uninteresting B-Plot and Lacklustre Climax,7.0,"WandaVision is Marvel Studios' first venture into television that is exclusively made for Disney+, the story picks up sometime after Avengers: Endgame with Wanda and Vision living in a quaint suburban area, however, they begin to suspect that not everything is as it seems. WandaVision stars Elizabeth Olsen as the titular character Wanda Maximoff alongside Paul Bettany who plays her love interest, Vision.

Like most, seeing the teasers to WandaVision left me very curious - Why is it in black and white? What is with the old 50/60's styled sitcom? How is Vision alive? - while all those questions were eventually answered, the show was of interest to me (even as someone who doesn't claim to be the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe). After getting a taste of the two's romance in previous MCU films, it is no surprise that Olsen and Bettany play well off each other - Wanda, the compassionate one that just wants to live a quiet life with a nuclear family and Vision, the calculated and philosophical love interest who always tries to do the right thing. The pair's chemistry is believable, and helps to move the story along even as things start to become more and more strange. There is a sense of mystery to the early parts of the show, one that is intriguing and promotes many questions, as was seen across different social media platforms each week, with fans trying to uncover what exactly was going on in Westview. Although all is explained near the latter half of the series, it may not satisfy those with creative theories. I for one didn't mind where the plot went, I thought it made sense and without spoilers paints the character of Wanda as a tragic figure, whereby her actions are understandable however easily scrutinized.

Now where my biggest problems lie with the show, has to be with its B plot and climax. I understand the secondary story is vital to explaining what's going on with the outside world, however, I never really found it to be all that interesting; in fact, I found it to really divert the momentum at points and take me out of the experience, leading to times where I felt like I was checking the time more often than I should and that is no more apparent than in episode 5 of the show. Some of my least favourite moments were when the story shifted outside of Westview and I found the clarification as to how the real world bled into the other world to be fairly anticlimactic, given what was set up. Speaking of the climax, the final episode to WandaVision really lost me - I had enjoyed the twist and some of the explanations given as to what was going on up to that point, but it wouldn't be the MCU if the pinnacle point in the story didn't divulge into a sequence of CGI action. I wish the show could have wrapped up in a quiet, less chaotic way than it did, I understand it was leading to a conflict however that conflict just ended up being the marvel trope of loud, brightly coloured action and that was frankly disappointing. It doesn't totally ruin the show, but it does detract from the overall experience considering what the show had built up.

Overall WandaVision was a decent ride, I loved the technical features of the show with transitioning between various aspect ratios and the little attention to detail given to what time period the episodes were paying homage to. It is a well-crafted show to a point; the story is intriguing and what it sets up has a satisfying enough pay-off, even if some of the plot points to get there are monotonous and the climax rather is underwhelming. I still do recommend WandaVision, it is a sufficiently good show that I'm sure will lend itself to the greater MCU story at hand and for that reason, I am giving WandaVision a 7/10."
5 March 2021,Simple incredible,8.0,Marvel really hit it out of the park with Wanda vision. First time they or anyone has tried something like this and it was amazing. Definitely a must watch.
15 February 2021,Shows definite promise,9.0,"Seems like a lot of 'reviewers' expect everything handed to them on a plate. Don't let the Disney logo fool you, folks. This is Marvel.

A lot of comments on here suggest that it doesn't get going until the fourth episode. Well, I had a strong 'hairs in the back of the neck' moment in episode 3 when Geraldine let something slip😉

I have given nine stars for what I've seen so far but may raise it once I've seen more.

Right then, episode 4 here I come!"
8 March 2021,Marvel's Newest Step Forward,8.0,
7 March 2021,Couldn't meet my expectations,6.0,"I mean there's nothing to say, the first three episodes boring as hell and they just messed up the finale like it was just too simple, even classic sitcoms were more interesting than this. they could end it only in three or four episodes, wonder what's the meaning of pulling it so long."
30 January 2021,"Don't hear other people, watch it you won't regretted",9.0,"A lot of persons say that I'd bad and all that stuff, honestly I feel like that at the beginning but all change, people just Star telling is a lazy end but tjapphat isn't actually fault of the ones that believe every theori that pop out, just watch it an enjoy."
29 March 2021,Captivating,9.0,"Viewed on: Disney+.

The first in a slate of MCU miniseries hitting Disney+, it follows Avengers Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch) & the Vision, both introduced in Avengers: Age of Ultron and until now have not had a standalone adventure. Set after the events of Avengers: Endgame, the two find themselves trapped in a reality based on classic sitcoms of years gone by that's centered on their day to day life as husband & wife.

I wasn't sure what to think of it going in, and while the first couple of episodes were kind of slow (though unique for the franchise), as things start to unravel & you slowly start to see the bigger picture it becomes a completely gripping experience. I don't typically binge watch a series over a short time, but I found myself chewing through this in a weekend, completely captivated by the weaving narrative.

Furthermore I thought it was cool how they aped the low fi special effects of classic sitcoms such as ""Bewitched"" for their superpowers in earlier episodes (which both allowed them to stick to theme & save their effects budget for the big happenings in later episodes), and I enjoyed the references to sitcoms that I grew up watching like ""Malcolm in the Middle"" in the later half."
19 January 2021,Please you've only seen 2 episodes!!!,10.0,Been waiting for a long time for this show to drop and unlike most I've waited a few days to watch the first 2 episodes although I have been reading reviews and the odd YouTube non spoiler video on theory's and what storylines most likely to be followed I really can't understand the negative reviews based on just TWO episodes especially when it a show that's going to be based on a progressive fantasy based world I wish watchers would understand what you see in episode 1 is not the same as episode 2 Take the limited camera angles and the sparsely decorated set compared to the next episode So please just give it a chance Marvel aren't going to unleash an Endgame style blockbuster via a tv show It's a show designed to build and feed into a future movie which I have no doubt the other Marvel tv shows will do They're simply a way to fill in the time MCU fans have to wait to get their fix!
16 February 2021,A good show that starts slow,10.0,Since ep4 it's gotten 10 times better. So give it a chance you won't regret it.
7 March 2021,literally dumber with each...,1.0,
15 January 2021,Baffling and bizarre,9.0,"I'm rating this after the first two episodes. What an impressive feat, melding the MCU with a 50's style sit com. The humor is of its time and the stories of that era. But, look underneath and you'll start to see something else, darker and portent. There are glimpses of pure SiFi here. A fantastic start. And for those wackos who assume all good reviews are sponsored, think again."
17 January 2021,So far so good,8.0,
15 January 2021,Point,7.0,What is the point of this show. I'm two episodes in and it's nothing but a early 1960s sitcom. Writing is awful. No real special effects. It doesn't even temped you to come back and watch the next episode. And what's with 8 minutes of credits at the end? Certainly 1000 people did work on it.
2 August 2021,Great but weird,7.0,
16 January 2021,Weird but wanting to see what happens,8.0,"This is pretty weird, but once you get that something is off it gets more interesting. Left me with wanting to see what happens next. However, I wish the little weird nuggets were more frequent. It's a slow build up. But I'm sure it'll be worth it."
5 March 2021,A good unique take.,8.0,"While watching this show, it was very confusing what was going on but I like the direction they were going for. As the episodes goes on, you started to learn about what's happening and there were shocking answers and twists here and there and I love that about WandaVision. This is something new we have never seen from Marvel and I think we can say we were all aboard on it. However, as much as I enjoyed the series, I can't but feel like there are some plotholes in few episodes and once you get to the ending, expectations were high but the execution was disappointing. I don't mind predictable things happening, but I don't like how it turns very generic. Despite this, I like the mystery of this show and characters, but I think I'm going to take a break from the MCU for awhile."
19 March 2021,One of the best series I have ever watched,10.0,"Wanda Vision for me was like watching Buffy for the first time, every episode brillant and I have haven't enjoyed a TV series for a long time like Wanda Vision. It will be in my yearly viewing just so enjoyed so much."
2 April 2021,Magical & Mysterious,9.0,
6 March 2021,If you have the time to waste...,3.0,"Then sure, go ahead and watch all 9 episodes. I've no one to blame but myself for getting sucked into the hype. This series - and Disney's handling of the MCU in general - are like buying a bag of potato chips. The packaging cost more than the contents and the bag is mostly air. And in the case of WandaVision, the potato chips themselves didn't taste so good and were stale."
24 January 2021,Why ? And ............. And again ............ And here we are -Epi 8,3.0,
15 January 2021,Review bombs are the unfortunate result of the popularity of this franchise,10.0,"With the mainstream appeal of a franchise like Marvel, you unfortunately get a mass of spectators who became marvel arm chair experts without knowing any of the source material or the overarching plots that are being laid before us. Which is why you are seeing posts absurdly review bombing this show with an undeserved sense of authority and indignation. Wandavision is a treat for any long time fan of Marvel (especially of Scarlet Witch and Vision). Those of us who have waited to see many of the aspects alluded to in the show are completely ecstatic in noticing every little hint cleverly woven into the plot. Those who've read comics like Tom King's take on Vision or House of M will certainly feel familiar elements. It's a greatly produced homage to sitcom history, with meticulously crafted sets that are authentically appropriate. And at the same time, it's also has a sort of psychological horror and mystery to it, which contrasts nicely in an idyllic yet unsettling setting. The best part about this show, is that a lot of it is happening between the lines. It's highly replayable and the weekly format is great because it keeps all the speculation and guesswork going. Every frame is filled to the brim with hints and clues as to what the ""mystery"" really is, what entities are really at play and what their motivations are. It's a really bold, creative swing for a generally safe and formulaic Marvel. And in my opinion, it's a completely successful one so far."
29 January 2021,I envisioned something different,9.0,"Love the writing and presentation. I understand and accept the style and format the show is presented in and appreciate it greatly. Pretty genius and different; I like this approach to story telling.

My biggest concern or nit pick is why didn't Wanda showcase the same powers or abilities during infinity wars? If she can rewind time, manipulate reality, change timelines or how events play out; then why not do that with Thanos?? And if Vision has a mind stone and is embedded with Jarvis, why is he such a dunce sometimes. He reads books for insight or acts stupidly at times as if he doesn't have the knowledge of Jarvis or all the information of the internet and Tony Stark at his fingertips. Just seems out of character for those two at times. If Wanda has these abilities in the show, she should have used them before the snap and if Vision has a mind stone and what I imagine as infinite knowledge, why read books or be completely clueless at times?"
3 March 2021,Unexpectedly brilliant,7.0,"After the Endgames I promised myself I was out of the marvel universe, time to be be adult and stop with this diverting fantasy nonsense. I mean 20 something films is a ridiculous commitment. The Spiderman movies didn't count so they were ok to watch but no more. Then this. Frivolous title. Kinda quirky. Nostalgic in all kinds of ways. But it builds. I'm writing this before the final episode comes out but I've been so impressed. By the astonishing attention to detail in every aspect of the storytelling. I can't fault it. It's a love story and it looks amazing. A week or so after the final episode, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier starts. Goddamn it! It'd better not be as good as this or I'm gonna get dragged in again. But I suspect it's too late."
5 March 2021,Marvel produces a Marvel.,10.0,The first few episodes will have Millennials neither loving or understanding what Marvel has created with WandaVision. True Marvel lovers embrace the Marvel brilliance and clinge to each carefully constructed scene as Wanda's story unfolds. By the final couple episodes the true excellence of Marvel really shines and WandaVision becomes absolutely magical. Starts as a 7/10 but definitely finishes as a 10/10
15 January 2021,Whole season reveiw,10.0,When you leave your theories behind and sit back and watch wandavision you have an origin story but not for wanda or vision but for the Scarlett Witch. Wandavision is truley about getting Wanda ready for phase four as the Scarlett Witch. But its also a story about grief and loss. Whilst the first 3 episodes are weird and different the rest of the show is truley brilliant and a great watch. Every actor does an amzing job in their roles and it was lovley to see the return of older MCU actors like Kat dennings. Overall if you are a marvel fan with an empty day watch it. If you're a fan of Wanda this is a must watch. If you are a casual MCU fan you can give it a miss but you will be missing out.
28 June 2021,WandaVision,10.0,
15 January 2021,"Why, marvel??",8.0,"They really thought they were going places with this..

This is totally not what most marvel fans wanna see. This show is completely different, it is a real sitcom! No offense, I love sitcons but if I wanted them, I'd never want a marvel one..

What a shame! I thought it was gonna be like the leaked plots instead of this. Maybe it's my fault tho, from the beginning they were adversiting it as it is and I expected something else."
8 March 2021,This is for the ending,10.0,"I think people thought this was supposed to be the conclusion of the Scarlet Witch.

It is not.... ITS THE BEGINNING PEOPLE!!

I'll admit, as a huge fan of the series and Scarlet Witch being my favorite avenger, the ending was kind of disappointing but I (unlike many others) understand that this was not supposed to be the conclusion of Wanda's story...instead the beginning of the Scarlet Witch saga. When you think about it, the conclusion perfectly sets up everything we need for phase 4 of the marvel universe... while I do belive that Wanda will now be a main protagonist(upsetting since she has been through so much) it's only logical."
19 February 2021,Yes guys marvel is BACK!!,10.0,"Tbh i wasn't expecting much from the show considering i have considered the romance of wanda and vision a little blah!! But the character arch wanda has gone through is mind blowing. And well we all ignore the sacrifice wanda and vision made in endgame. Wanda is surely one of my all time fav avenger now after ofcourse thor. Back to the show the suspense they build up throughout, the style of shooting, presenting, the new twists, the new superheroes, the villians everything seems so right. It started slow but here i say it WANDAVISION IS ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOW EVER CREATED.

People who are saying they didn't like the finale are seriously stupid because it had everything. Ok may be not some cameos we were expecting but that doesn't make the show bad. And what about the two credit scenes. I mean wow!!!. Can we expect to see wanda as the villian for doctor strange, well your guess is as good as mine. Will vision return....... Well classic marvel."
3 March 2021,Worth the time,10.0,"Good, clean, unique fun. If you're not coming in looking for something groundbreaking or full of action, give this a shot. It's fun, it's clever and it will leave you feeling like TV doesn't need to solve the problems of the world."
15 January 2021,An enigma,8.0,"The first two episodes were intriguing and crap in equal measure... I want to know where it's heading but it needs to get there a bit quicker, it either needed to be released all on one hit or had the 1950's slapstick mixed with a bit more modern day stuff. And those credits! Is there really any need for nearly 10 minutes worth?"
26 November 2021,Different,7.0,"This series deffinatly stood out on its own, but in a good way. Its not what you would expect from marvel, at least not for the few episodes anyway. I'm a sitcom guy so i appreciate their sitcom thro the decades approach they used, it was a good throwback to some old sitcoms i use to watch."
31 January 2021,WOW WATCH THEM ALL,10.0,"Brilliant programme, can't wait for more episodes. You NEED to watch them all and get through the two episodes, it's revealed why they were shown and makes sense. WATCH!!!

However, they should have released the whole season at once. This could have prevented some of the poor reviews. Everyone binge watches series these days, no need for 30 minute or less episodes once a week, a bit ridiculous to be honest.

Overall, an entertaining, smart production, but the weekly release is letting it down. 100% worth the watch, but it's just a shame. Probably a money grabbing scam from Disney and/or Marvel."
15 January 2021,"Dumb,stupid,not funny",3.0,"This is just a sad remake of Bewitched. For all you youngins who have never heard of Bewitched,look it up! Im gonna keep watching and hope it gets better but so far its not working for me."
16 January 2021,what a let down,6.0,I had been looking forward to this show ever since i learned of its release and what a let down it was. nothing redeemable about this show what so ever. not funny in the slightest and the canned laughter is really annoying. granted i only watched 2 episodes but boy it was bad. seems you can polish any old turd if you put marvel in front of it.
23 January 2021,Stunningly bad,1.0,This is beyond bad it is utter drivel from start to finish.
9 March 2021,"I'm glad I stayed with it. There is comedy, mystery, drama and more, but it takes a few episodes.",10.0,"I'm not really up on the Marvel Universe, so I was unfamiliar with these characters or their backstories, but it didn't matter. I really enjoyed this more and more as the episodes progressed. it's not just action figures with superpowers and special effects. Nor is just a send-up of old sitcoms as it may initially appear. (Though those are really well-done.) It evolves into a much more complex and darker story.

Some things that caught my attention: There is a reference at one point to the Dick Van Dyke ""It May Look Like a Walnut"" episode (Google it), which is genius. In another episode, a movie marquee contains a reference to a really poignant scene in Blade Runner. Elsewhere, two characters discuss the Ship of Theseus (If, in the course of repairing it, you ending up replacing every piece, is it still the Ship of Theseus?). There are a number of instances of thoughtful writing, which is helpful for people who want more than just special effects. One demerit: the stereotyping of an older white, WASP-y male as a heavy-handed villain, who is opposed by feisty, racially diverse, younger characters. This may be required on all television shows now, but it's still pandering, it's offensive, and it's so predictable that it detracts from the suspense."
22 April 2021,"It's not art, it's just bad story telling",3.0,"Five minutes into the first episode something happed that had never happend before: the whole family except for me stopped watching. I get that the writers wanted to integrate the evolution of soaps into the series. But if you want to pull this off you better make sure it is either extremely funny or put an intruiging element right there in the beginning. Now it were just a couple of super boring episodes with no interesting plot. It gets better once you get past the first couple of episodes. Only then the actual story begins. But still, the story elements from the first episodes could have just as well been integrated with the later episodes. I'd give it a 5/10 if the story had developped properly after these first episodes but I decided not to. The ending was rather frustrating with ridiculous floating people on wires and all to convenient turnarounds. It could have been worse, but not that much worse."

17 January 2021,So far so good,8.0,I'll start by saying that this is an acquired taste and if you aren't familiar with some of the comics/deeper lore this is likely to confuse you. Applause to Disney for nailing the 50s theme. There is something so intriguing about this. You know that's there is something going on behind the curtain and the show gives you just enough peeks to keep you invested. Although a few more peeks wouldn't go amiss I'm definitely curious to see where this will go.
6 March 2021,great ahow,8.0,
8 March 2021,Amazingly Refreshing!!!,10.0,"Just like a Old School Comic Book!!! The world of Marvel is endless,keep the creativity coming!!!

AWESOME!!!"
1 August 2021,Surprising,8.0,"When I entered this show, I was not sure what to expect. This was going to be the first Marvel TV show that is connected to the cinematic universe. The only Marvel show I saw before this was Agent Carter, which is a shame that it was canceled as it was one of my favourite shows.

To put it simply, this show was a ride! And it was absolutely fun trying to piece out the story and it's connection to the Marvel universe through tidbits in every episode. Not to mention it is experimental with filming as a medium, and the film student in me was having a blast at seeing how those all connect to the overarching story.

Definitely recommend this TV show!"
15 January 2021,Bad call for Disney to release this weekly,7.0,"It seems like the whole of this show should've been put out at once because something will definitely finally happen in later episodes. The first 2 were just complete nothingness.

I'm definitely intrigued by what's to come but at this stage I cannot recommend it to anyone. The cracks in the ""reality"" were finally starting to show at the end of the second episode so let's hope it picks up from there.

On high point was definitely Vision being ""gum drunk"", Paul Bettany nailed that, was pretty hilarious."
5 March 2021,This should NOT be allowed on TV!,10.0,"This series is nothing short of amazing. Loved every minute of it. You get introduced to new characters and meet some old ones again. Every character is well written and all the actors are great on screen. This is very different from usual MCU stuff and it was for the better.

Elizabeth Olsen deserves an Emmy nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. She did amazing and blew me away everytime she was on screen. This might be a stretch but I also think it should at least be nominated for Best Director in a (Drama) Series. This was a show that could have easily done bad but it was great and you DEFINITELY need to watch it. Something as good as this should be allowed to be on tv because it is way to good and will have you staying up late at night to watch the new episode. Please do yourself a favor and watch this show!"
27 April 2021,Excellent concept brought to life by a not so excellent showrunner,8.0,
15 January 2021,"Perfect, perfect oh and it's perfect!",10.0,"It's absolutely an amazing, Great, magical show!! It deserves the best awards Keep it This way Marvel!!"
15 January 2021,Just WOW!,8.0,"A mix of Bewitched, The Honeymooners, and a swirl of Marvel Cinematics and you have this lovely sitcom."
25 January 2021,Purile twaddle of the lowest order,1.0,"One lives in hope rabid rats will attack the producers for this dire excuse for anything.

2 episodes were 2 too many.

Next time it comes on I'll be bleaching my bottom..."
7 March 2021,Weirdly entertaining,9.0,"I'm not sure how to rate this. It was very good and ridiculously interesting, but I feel it was lacking something. Maybe it was better...but this doesn't take anything away from how amazingly beautiful this show has been! I'm sad to see it end."
14 April 2021,Coming from a harsh critic of the MCU,8.0,"Look, I get what the MCU did for cinema and today's culture as a whole, I'm not blind. I don't like them though. Most of them are watered down versions of shadows of great thoughts.

This show, however, though it devolves quickly near the end of the season to something resembling a shallow and undeservedly showy late 90's children's movie, is a great homage to the evolution of television and culture. It creates real characters and asks full questions throughout. It's worth your relaxation time."
16 January 2021,"It's not Going to get you to Laugh Out Loud, but it will definitely entertain you",,"Some comments say that the show is not funny, and it's true, but you can enjoy it without effort for the story and the intrigue this is definitely being som of my favorite Marvel Stuff"
16 January 2021,"Just watch the original ""Bewitched""",6.0,"WandaVision is meant to be an ironic take on sixites sitcoms featuring the supernatural, primarily Betwitched. Betwitched features Samantha, a witch married to a mortal. But the original Betwitched is more contemporary (and ironic) than this smirky remake. Samantha had an outspoken mother, Endora, who's questioning of Sam's lifestyle takes on a feminist note. And there was Gladys, the suspicious neighbor, wonderfully played by character actress Sandra Gould. Darren, Samantha's husband is a decent, kind man who loves his wife unconditionally, even though he doesn't understand her. Darren's boss Larry harasses his female employees, and the series questions his behavior it even as it plays it for laughs. Bewitched's gentle irony and it's questioning of contemporary values holds beautifully. The best thing about WandaVision is the music. It does genuinely capture the mood of the times and gives the series a sparkle it doesn't quite deserve."
15 January 2021,Bewitched remake,7.0,"Ok, as a kid I used to watch Bewitched and I dream of Jeannie, these 60's shows were so naive and sweet that I somewhat missed them, this will probably not last longer than one season, because most people will be like wtf, heh I do somewhat enjoy this ..."
13 February 2021,"Excellent so far but clouds loom on the horizon. - and guess what, there was a thunderstorm",2.0,"I like the premise and the story very much The show has really done a lot of great things. It so far is very well thought out with clues from episode 1 and a number of very nice concepts in terms of the progression of the show.

The jewel in the crown however is the chemistry between PB and EO which is truly beautiful to see. The fact that they can act so well together makes me wonder if Infinity War and Endgame would not have benefited from having significantly more focus on these Avengers (it should be noted that in the comics they are more important avengers than they were in the movies).

Olsen and Bettany have demonstrated in this show that they are truly top class actors and they make the entire thing. In addition the writing is very intelligent and interesting and everything seems to tie together well.

However there are some indications that Disney is playing bait and switch here by pushing small delicate ""woke"" ideas slowly but surely into the story. One example is claiming that Wanda and Captain Marvel could have each single handedly taken down Thanos. The reality is that in terms of power, both of them just could not compare to Thanos with even one infinity stone let alone all of them and that both Thor and the Hulk, and arguably even the vision (especially with his stone) would be more powerful than either. These little hints, and the fact that Disney has this tendency to ruin good things with their ""woke ideologies"" prevents me from going 10/10 on this review.

If it turns out that I am wrong about where this is going, I will amend this review up to probably 10/10 given almost perfect production values and one of the most interesting stories to date from the Marvel stables, but if I am right I will also amend downward.

Please Wandavision focus on the relationship between Wanda and the Vision and less on some ideological (lack of) morality play and you will have on your hands maybe the best show of the decade.

AND RIGHT AFTER THIS.

The entire thing collapsed. Wanda and the Vision basically stopped interacting in the last few episodes and every single tie in lead that looked as if it was going somewhere great ended up going to zero.

This has turned into some sort of feminist trope with the usual stuff - male/female segregation plus other evil things, and an ending that was the worst possible one.

Well done Disney, another hit turned into a disaster because you wanted to moralize - guess what you guys ARE the badies..."
5 March 2021,What a great mcu tv series,10.0,I loved it from episode 3 and u get excited for the next episode every-time can't wait for spider man no way home and doctor strange and the multiverse of madness what a great mcu phase 4 start
12 March 2021,"Starts weird, ends with the ultimate cliché",6.0,"The first couple of episodes were... strange. But we like strange. Anything that ends up being a memorable experience starts out as something we don't understand. However, as the episodes goes by, it becomes apparent that this magic trick, with its elaborate setup, is just the usual sleight of hands that have been done to death already. It plays right into the superhero tropes that we were hoping it would subvert. And in the last 2 episodes, I think it really falls apart, and fails to even be that, by introducing villains and new powers that seem to distract the plot pointlessly from the central theme. It's a patched up random mess, that tries to be too much and ends up being nothing."
30 January 2021,So I waited until episode 4...,1.0,"And it was still crap. Like some people cant understand the low reviews, I can't understand the high reviews. This is just another overrated marvel tv show. It doesn't do anything new or groundbreaking, perhaps it's a different take on the marvel universe but nothing special. But it doesn't even need to be special, it just shouldn't be boring and cliche'."
18 January 2021,the show is good,8.0,"I was a bit skeptical on watching the show because of the low reviews I kept seeing, I decided to check it out myself and am confused as to why people are bashing the show. There are so many easter eggs in just the two episode that I kept rewatching for scenes I missed, the comedy in the show is actually really good and I had quite the laugh watching the show. it obviously look like it's gonna get better as we move on in the show, fake marvel fans complaining like children, you just watch less than 44 minutes of a show and suddenly you call it crap."
26 February 2021,Unlike anything else I have ever seen,10.0,"This show is inventive, quirky, dramatic, emotional and exciting. And all without conforming to the TV norms or any particular genre.

The performances are subtle, engaging and executed perfectly and the vision (excuse the pun) of the entire concept is spot on.

If you watch the first one or two episodes and decide it is not for you, I urge you to persevere because it is genuinely wonderful, unique television. Highly recommended for Marvel fans and other fans alike"
20 January 2021,So far it's boring but...,6.0,
16 February 2021,So Funny!,10.0,Disney did such a great job with a very risky move. They completely nail it! The production is fenomenal portraying the 60's to todays date of Avengers. Beautiful work!
16 January 2021,I don't understand the low reviews.,10.0,"It says right in the Trivia section that this series serves as a link to ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"". That right there should give you a clue that all is far from what it seems. Enjoy the comedy and weirdness now, because I feel there's a turn coming..."
3 May 2022,Great Show,10.0,For all the people that posted the negative reviews should take them back. This show does have a point. She is the Scarlett Witch now. She was in the post credit of Spider Man No Way Home and will be in Dr. Strange 2. She could be the Villain.
16 January 2021,Crap,2.0,"Well, I'm glad that Disney are trying to get back to their, ""roots"", by trying bring out 50s/60s sitcom feel with a modern twist. But just not as entertaining and isn't very imaginative. It's more of a ripoff of Bewitch. But then it transforms into something even more dreadful. Pure crap!"
6 March 2021,Not everyone's cup of tea,5.0,"Character development was arguably arduous in that it spent entirely too much time on the show within the show. Ultimately it boiled down to the last of a few of 9 episodes to get to the point of the story. And granted, the ending was a real emotional tear jerker. But for those who stayed through the entire closing credits of the last episode, much was revealed about the potential future of the series and forthcoming Marvel Universe. We'll have to see what the next chapter holds, but I honestly found much of the first season far too campy for me; direction flailing, annoying scripting, over acting with characters who didn't appear truly believable. Ultimately, one either buy's into WandaVision completely or is dragged through it somewhat resentfully. I being the latter. I would also like to see more emphasis placed on production values; as an example, some of the sets were less than optimal. I'm sure there will be those who will find my observations unrelatable, but remember, art is always in the eye of the beholder."
5 March 2021,Done with the MCU,2.0,"If this is the level of writing we can expect moving forward, I'm done. This series is a dumpster fire that makes no sense when you put the entirety of it under the microscope."
11 January 2022,"Booring -,-",1.0,"We watched the first two episodes and stopped after. Usually my boyfriend and me watch a lot. Especially from the Marvel universe. And I mean a lot. We even watched the whole season of Iron fist, which is by the way horrible and badly written but still more thrilling than ""this"".

This series might get to a point where it starts to be exciting but I will never know. It should be at least motivating enough to watch it til the end. It's not. :("
22 January 2021,Good things come to those who wait....,10.0,The first two episodes may have been something many people didn't like but even the creators mentioned it's gonna have a massive change in coming episodes. The third episode managed to meet our expectations for instance. Don't rate the series rate the episode!!
2 September 2022,Incredible,10.0,"Wandavision starts the sequence of marvel series incredibly. After lost her husband, Vision, that helps and stays with her for at least 5 years, Wanda freak out and starts using her magic in kind of a bad way and that is what the serie is about. The acting is a uncredible thing, Elisabeth Olsen is the perfect Wanda Maximoff, she acts like she really lot her husband and all of her friends. The scenes of her crying made every one feel for and with her. Unfortuly, the first episode is very confusing, what make a lot of people give up and jump for the next serie. But that is a huge mistake, because like I said, is an incredible and choging serie, besides the fact that it changes the couse of all the marve's series and movies that will come below."
12 February 2021,Give it time continues to get better,9.0,I just kept watching every week and I'm so glad I did. Just gets better and better. Love it and glad that marvel is continuing to put out great material like this. Can't wait to see the rest of the marvel shows when they release.
16 January 2021,I don't get it.,3.0,Makes no sense to me. Who are you appealing to? Kids? No. They don't see the appeal of a 50's theme. To die hard marvel fans? This is not true Marvel. I'm sure Falcon and the winter Soldier will be more classic Marvel. Whoever came up with this concept needs to be fired. What a crap way to kick off Marvel mini-series in Disney+.
16 January 2021,I get it's parodying 60s sitcoms but it's unwatchable,1.0,My biggest complaint is the dreadful performances by the 2 leads. Neither has any comic timing. Elizabeth Olsen is painful to watch. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be comedy. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. I will try episode 3 out of curiosity but it's been a struggle to watch this.
1 April 2021,Pure B.S,1.0,Dont even waste even a second on this. It is dreadful.
20 April 2021,Ponder-Vision,3.0,"During lockdown I've been able to watch some great TV shows I had missed out on - Ozark, Ash vs the Evil Dead, Ted Lasso, Dirk Gently to name a few.

Wandavision isn't one of them.

A completely misguided, badly scripted, poorly planned, terribly structured mess. The whole set up, the whole premise is just a terrible, reaching a new low with the song ending Episode 7. I mean, come on, a lot more could have been achieved with these characters and this cast, but it ended up being an unfunny shambles of a series.

My advice to anyone who wants to stay up-to-date with the various branches of the MCU is to just watch the last few minutes of each episode, instead if putting yourself through the terribleness of each episode, and then maybe watch the last 2 episodes in full. The rest of it you don't really need, and you can always watch some YouTube 'round up' videos for anything you've missed.

A special mention goes to Kat Dennings. How she ended up in this I will never know. A terrible and annoying actress somehow got herself Into this amazing franchise. The mind boggles at times."
10 March 2021,Disappointed,5.0,
6 February 2021,dont judge too early!,10.0,Now that 5 episodes have come out the show is really turning into something insane. Marvel is creating the next big step in the mcu and this show is the starting point. its a must watch
25 April 2021,"Thank you for choosing me,,,,,",8.0,"This was awesome!!

The show starts with Wanda and Vision in wedding clothes, and they are starting their new lives in small town America,, except everything is in black and white,, and it's circa 1950s. There is no mention of any events that have taken place in the past few years (such as Thanos, the blip,, certain deaths!!).

The supporting cast is excellent. Especially that one blast from the past (or completely other franchise).

I loved how they just started the show with no explanation of anything, and little by little we find out what's going on."
29 January 2021,"Bad acting, bad storytelling with bad characters",1.0,"I waited until the 4th episode to write a review since I wanted to see if this was going where I thought it was going, and of course it did.

Two of the problems with this show is that they have bad writers and no actors to pull it off. Since I know that Bettany is one of the best actors I have ever seen my conclusion is that the writers and directors have no idea what to do nor how to build this world in a good way. But they also hired bad actors to fill out most other roles. I remember a police officer saying two sentences and believed his acting more than 90% of the others on this show.

The core problem however is the storytelling. Sure this too have to do with the writing and directing, but what I mean is that they are trying to sell this mind-trip and Wanda weirdo power thingie in a bad way. They should have skipped at least one of the 3 first episodes and they should have got better actors to sell it. Got better writers, better costume department, better everything.

Elizabeth Olsen especially suck. She is not a good actress, and have never been good in anything. She is not bad, she simply not good. She has done a good job in a couple of Marvel movies, but that is because she was surrounded by excellent actors, great writers and good directors so they knew how to use her lack of talent in the best way, here it does not work.

A few other problems; The short episodes which never have the time to tell the story so we are constantly left hanging wondering what horrible turd we are watching.

Everything cinematic is also badly handled - music bad, light bad, scenes and set pieces bad, so this world they are trying to build look ugly and badly filmed.

A final complaint is that they give us SWORD in this way! What a horrible bad way to get us into this organisation, what a extremely atrocious way of telling us about Monica Rambeau and her mother and their ties to the organisation in question. Extremely badly done and a real middle-finger to all the fans.

Is there anything good with this?

Well, there is some potential. I still have not completely given up. I will watch one or two more episodes, but I cannot see them turning this around. Miscast all-around, bad writing, bad storytelling, bad directing, and horrible handling of SWORD. And where is SHIELD? The first two people I would call in this situation would be Fitz & Simmons, but nah, not even this they can do right.

I will give the show one extra bonus point for referring to Captain Marvel and having Monica waking up to Brie Larson voice... so I give it a 3/10 because of that and the possible potential...

I would not recommend this to anyone. If this take an unexpected turn for the better I will come back and re-write this review, but for now this is very bad TV and by far the worst TV show Marvel has ever done. This is on par with the worst of the Arrowverse and I cannot think of a lower grade. Supergirl is better than this... imagine that... Brrr...

---update --- 5 episodes in and this is among the worst ever seen. A couple of interesting nods to Captain Marvel got me a bit curious, but that is it among all the turds... so lowering the score to 2/10.

Next episode better be amazing otherwise I am ut

---update 2 --- 6 episodes. I am ut. This suck on so many levels. What a piece of absolute garbage. Wanda is a evil sociopath, Darcy should be in jail, Jimmy should be fired and in jail. The moral of this show is that you can torture and kill folk and it is all good..."
18 February 2021,(Review for episodes 1 to 6 so may change as the series goes along),10.0,"Love Marvel, most of their work keeps me entertained and I am excited for the future, though regarding this series...

*Episode 1 and 2.

First two episodes are pretty average, border line below average as I have zero want to see them again. There has hardly been anything story wise (I think there may have been around 30 seconds altogether!) and the shows it is paying homage to were better.

The jokes mostly fall flat, if anything they're outdated and at best might get a smirk out of you.

*Episode 3.

My only gripe with the third episode is that the style of the show is supposed to be paying homage to TV through the different generations but where they have updated the look, they forgot to update the jokes and dialogue to fit the time they are supposed to be in.

Though I would say that the third episode is much better than the first two as there are more story elements and the episode will not only make you ponder but also wanting more.

*Episode 4

Best episode of the season so far, was expecting them to continue the trend and we'd see the 80's here but no, though not complaining as was thrilled with them showing us what is happening on the outside instead.

From the opening scene this episode will keep you hooked and unlike the first three this episode feels more similar to their movies. The inclusion of two fan favourite 'minor' characters will put a smile on your face too.

My only problem with this episode is it's too short. lol

*Episode 5

On par, if not better than episode 4. The cinematography for this episode is perfect. To change from the 80's to current time in a whim without the audience feeling like they are watching two different shows is no easy task but they have got it right in this episode.

Very pleased with the 80's style they chose as they didn't go the cliché route that most shows do when they revisit the 80's and stuck with what a program was like during that time.

Elizabeth Olsen has been great through all the episodes but imo this episode is where Paul Bettany shines, and compared to the previous episodes, this episode is where Paul Bettany has looked most comfortable.

And wow what an ending....

Episode 4 and 5's quality moves my overall rating of the show from a 3 to a 4.

Episode 6*

Another great episode. Maybe not as good as the last two but still not bad. Despite the intro and a certain movie alluding to the 00's we are in the 90's here, and growing up in the 90's it was nice to remember good memories of the ps1 and dance dance revolutions. 😄 As this episode is set during Halloween it has a Eerie Indiana feel to it, which is also a nice throwback.

So far the show has been good at making you second guess and change your mind on what is actually happening every week, which is not a bad thing but I am expecting answers in the next three, as another episode that makes you think differently may start to annoy as we are getting close to the end."
21 July 2021,Best story EVER!!!,10.0,I've read thousands of books and comics. Yet this is the single BEST story I've EVER experienced. And it'll forever haunt me. If you don't watch it you haven't lived a full life.
20 February 2021,"I Know Marvel Fan Won't Miss this, But Even a Non Marvel Fan can Watch This.",10.0,"Definitely it is an Entertainer I Don't know why i can't miss Any Marvel Movie or series. It's Up to you , U Wanna See it or Not."
8 February 2021,God I wish I could swear here,7.0,"Just please, wait until you're far into the show to rate it, because this thing is not instant gratification. Did you expect marvel to make a full on sitcom?? Have you watched the trailers?? Those who reviewed it the day it came out, watch more, you'll enjoy it much more."
21 January 2022,It's not what you'll expect,10.0,I was a bit reluctant to watch this cz I wasn't really attached to both Wanda & vision before THIS. Oh how they exceeded my expectations. It's everything that was missing in the MCU. The eerily vibe between old sitcom gold is just brilliant. Will always have a special place in my heart.
10 March 2021,Awesome story line,9.0,Without any doubt best tv series of this year...Wanda ...you beauty. everything was perfect.
17 January 2021,WTF? BUT SO FAR WHAT A RIDE!,8.0,
8 October 2023,loved,10.0,
27 February 2021,Interesting but what's the point,7.0,Just finished watching episode 8 and while I enjoy the show I'm still wondering what's the point?
14 February 2021,This show is from another universe,9.0,"Marvel shows us they are not from this world. They took a new take on superhero series. What a wonderful build-up, it started at a slow pace and it showcases a perfect character development for each new and old character. Makes tiny references to the mcu and easter eggs, and now we can't stop asking for more, but I have one complaint, this show is to short. It has a short runtime but it makes sense cos old shows were 30 minutes long. I just can't wait for the season finale. I pray it has a second season."
26 September 2021,"Don't bother looking at the negative reviews. They either didn't understand, or missed the point.",10.0,
26 March 2021,ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW.,8.0,"I feel like I can say this is one the best Marvel Tv Shows I have ever seen, big statement I know but hear me out.

I wasn't really big fan of Wanda, i didn't even wanted to watch this but now I'm glad I did. It's gonna make you really sympathy with Wanda and you will feel her pain after watching this.

Acting is on point for Marvel it's usual, but I have stick out Elizabeth Olsen performance because she really put her best for this show. The whole cast really know what they doing and it's very visible. AMAZING

Matt Shaakman is a genius, I have never in my life seen anything like this and I'm really amazed by his job as a director for this tv show. CGI is getting better and better the execution is AMAZING

But the plot is something unoriginal, I mean you have no idea what is going on until the last episode where everything makes sense but the ending plot is really meh.

Overall this show is really amazing, totally recomended you will enjoy your time."
12 January 2022,Original,9.0,
18 March 2021,Good,10.0,A very good web series of vision life and wanda life this series make my mood refresh
5 March 2021,A Satisfying Conclusion With Endless Possibilities For The Future,7.0,"The WandaVision finale is the first big showdown of Phase 4 of the MCU! Rarely has a show captured human emotions as well as this one! Deep character studies with ramifications leading to some of the most satisfying moments in the ENTIRE MCU! This show has proven that you can turn secondary characters into main characters without making it seem forced! Wanda Maximoff might just turn out to be the best and most complex character in the entire MCU! Talk about a female character written RIGHT! I am completely baffled by how the MCU still manages to keep audiences worldwide interested and super engaged in their material! Just when I thought Endgame was the MCU's peak, I'm now thinking it might get even BIGGER which is extremely hard to fathom! To the episode 9 viewers, let the credits roll COMPLETELY! The future of the MCU is looking more exciting than it ever has! The sheer possibilities for more great storytelling and intriguing directions they could take the MCU to, leave me super excited and fulfilled for the upcoming MCU projects! You already know I'll be rewatching this show like 10 times ;)"
22 January 2021,so far so good,9.0,"I really like it that a marvel tv show tries some new things. Just watched ep 3, and can't wait for the next one, very interesting and surprising !"
8 April 2021,WandaVision Review.... Fantasic show by Marvel,9.0,
15 January 2021,Oh this is REALLY bad,1.0,"Having read the premise I wasn't expecting much. I was expecting more than this. After 2 mins I simply couldn't take anymore of the canned laughter and had to switch it off. Yes I get that it's supposed to be them stuck in a sitcom but there's canned laughter every time someone moves or speaks. And I mean EVERY TIME.

Wanda switches a light on - canned laughter. Vision gets out of bed - canned laughter Wanda walks in to shot - canned laughter Vision turns look at Wanda - canned laughter

The premise is bad but the actual show is AWFUL"
12 February 2021,Marvel masterpiece,10.0,"It is a total marvel masterpiece It has everything action, suspense, humour, etc Wow it is great Thanks marvel for this"
23 January 2021,very weak,3.0,"Probably not my type of show, it has something but it's very boring

3 episodes it's enough for me to know i dont need more"
16 January 2021,Bizarre but great,10.0,"Perfect acting (especially Elizabeth Olsen), intriguing plot. Westview is highly understandable portrayal of post-Endgame Scarlet Witch. She lost everything between Age of Ultron and Endgame. This is her happy ending."
24 December 2021,Why oh why can't there be a 2nd season,7.0,"I hated episode 1 but from episode 2, things slowly built up to a fantastic ending. The storyline and Actors were perfect and continued what Ironman started. In a way I wish the boring ones (e.g. Hawkeye & Falcon/ winter.....) had aired 1st then saved the best e.g. Wandavision, for last."
31 January 2022,the best Marvel series on Disney+ for me,9.0,"Incredible that a year has passed since the premiere of this series and it continues to be the best Marvel series on Disney+ for me. I would put it as first and then Hawkeye and Loki last, as the best Marvel series today. And despite the fact that this 2022 looks promising for new Marvel series, only time will tell us if these new series that will arrive soon will manage to surpass what Wandavision was."
2 May 2023,A great way to start off Phase 4 of the MCU,9.0,"WandaVision is the first of a handful of shows to come to the MCU, kicking off Phase 4 in style. Living suburban lives, super powered beings Wanda Maximoff and Vision are living the life they have always dreamed of, until they begin to suspect that not all is what it seems. The series is colorful, stylish, and often very dark at times for it being in the MCU, bringing us a story unlike no other that's been in the MCU. When it comes to the two leads, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany as Wanda Maximoff and Vision are the best versions of their MCU characters that they have ever been, making us want more of the both of them together by the time all nine episodes are done. Kathryn Hahn as Agatha Harkness was fine. She was definitely the oddest character of the whole show, but overall was fine. Teyonah Parrish's Monica Rambeau was definitely one of my favorite characters of the show and I can't wait to see her more in the future. I was also glad to see the returns of Jimmy Woo and Darcy Lewis played by Randall Park and Kat Dennings. Overall, this is definitely one of the weirdest, but stylish projects to the MCU, that kicks off Phase 4 in style that also shows that some stories can be shown as TV shows. Rating 9/10."
16 January 2021,Finally! A fresh idea out of Hollywood!,,"Very enjoyable, good humour, great acting and writing...*very classy*!

So much better than most of the other lame series being offered to us from Hollywood lately!"
5 February 2021,Need to see at least 4 eps to 'get',9.0,"Eps 1-3 could be hard going for some (but others will enjoy 'as is').... but when you have ep 4 under your belt, it all comes together.

If someone has seen ep 4, pay attention; if not.... look at another review.

For what its worth, I have watched 1-5 (5 was released today) and I am annoyed I can't get to Ep 6 yet!"
31 March 2021,Not Your Average Marvel Movies,8.0,"After watching the first episode all I could think is Billy Bat. Great manga by Naoki Urasawa. There is mystery written everywhere. I keep guessing what will come next, where this series is going. And the wait paid off after the fourth episode. Still more mystery.

This is not like any other Marvel Movies. It is darker. But don't worry there are still some humor to like. The casting is great, the production is good. With a twist here and there.

My only problem is the episodes are too short. I think they should add more minutes to explain things. Like where is the witches come from. What is inside the book. What is the power of Rambeau. And I wish they make the final with more action. The last fight is not as gritty as other Marvel Movies."
22 January 2021,"Come on , Why don't you like it",,"Wandavision is a good and innovative show which combines mind games with sitcom . This is basically legion but for kids ( so , you will not see and "" adult content "" and "" very confusing and complex story "" that will make your mind messed up) and combined it with friends (but not as funny as friends of course ). Sounds good right . If you dont like it , just give it another shot , maybe you like it . Just my opinion . And Also I think it should be released as a whole season at once since the cliffhanger at the end of all episodes are not good compared to other shows."
21 January 2021,WTF is this!?!,1.0,Is holly weird declining? This was beyond lame...super lame
8 March 2021,Good one!,9.0,
14 September 2021,I cringed all the way,8.0,"I've only watched the first 2 episodes, but i can't watch more. I watched this with my family and all of us felt weird. We was expecting a 'AvengersMovie-Like' tv show, and it wasn't at all."
23 January 2021,A lot of people are overreacting.,9.0,Rate the EPISODES not the whole season! It doesn't make sense to put in a rating and review for the whole season when only 2 or 3 episodes are out. Where's the logic with that??? There's sections where you can go and rate/review the individual episodes. Then when the season is over go and put in a rating for the season. At this point people are just excessively review bombing it.
3 February 2021,A mind blower!,8.0,"I stumbled upon this series by chance. I was born in the late '60s so I just decided to keep watching because I love Marvel's stories. At first, it reminded me of Bewitched who I used to love but this is deliberately overacted with an exaggerated laughing audience in the background. I grew up with sitcoms but I wasn't planning to watch one so, after the first 5 minutes of the second episode, I got bored and stopped watching. Why would Marvel get involved in such nonsense, I asked myself so it was only after I watched the mid season trailer on YouTube that I decided to continue watching and now I'm hooked. If you are patient, things will start to unfold in a very unexpected way."
15 January 2021,Give it a chance! Brilliant premise!,8.0,"Seriously, you cannot get the gist of a show after two episodes, and just over one hour of broadcast. Jeez. From what I've seen, it looks like it's going to be really interesting. I'm curious to see what's going to happen and who is responsible for Wanda and Vision being trapped, and why? I feel there is so much more to come, especially after the clues in that second episode. It's funny, too. Loved the guest turns from Debra Jo Rupp and Emma Caulfield Ford. Bring it on!"
16 January 2021,I know I should like it...!!!,,"Every review says I should like it, it's great, it's a pastiche of the old 1950's comedy classics but somehow misses the point which is what it's supposed to do I guess? After only 2 episodes my question is still 'why' so I'll have to wait and see."
6 March 2021,Reviewed after watching ALL episodes,5.0,"By the end, I was reminded of Agents of SHIELD (and the tenuous connection with the movies), where it was noticeable this was made for TV in the script, storytelling and scope.. I would compare this to the lesser quality plots in the ANT MAN films, except it wasn't as fun.

The series started great (the first 3 episodes are amazing in what it is doing), with a good mystery and a lot of interesting questions to be answered. Then, was VERY disappointed when reaching the final episodes and my expectations were a lot higher that what was portrayed on screen. There is no ""game changer"" (or at least doesn't feel like there is), or lasting consequences. Pretty much everything goes back to the way it was. You can't start it that way and not deliver.. that is your ONE job! To blow people away with the revelations. It only gives you Evan Peters for a few episodes, and Photon (which I expect to return to normal, like everything else).

NITPICK :




Dr Strange is going to have to work really hard to make me care about this show. EDIT: It didn't."
17 January 2021,Super boring,4.0,Really hard to get through first 2 episodes. They aren't that funny or intriguing maybe the show will pick up in later episodes. I think it's a mistake releasing this weekly as it's not gripping enough so far for me to want to follow this show
15 January 2021,Finally!,10.0,Marvel Studios' first series and starts on the right foot!
3 February 2021,Please keep on watching after episode 2,9.0,Title says it all. Some easter eggs in episode 1 and 2 but I understand how they might not be your cup of tea. But as of episode 3 I was really intrigued. And by episode 4 I was actually pretty sold. The build up is done really well. Will update grade at end of season but as of now it's a pretty Solid 7/10.
15 January 2021,Too Soon To Speculate But Here Are My Thoughts,5.0,
22 January 2021,Wow,10.0,"This thing is really starting to get interesting. I'm a fan of the whole sitcom thing, but those last 5 minutes.. just wow"
15 January 2021,Massive contradiction to the mcu,1.0,
15 January 2021,Fantastic start to a superhero mystery,10.0,"A very promising intriguing start for WandaVision. Can't wait for the rest of the episodes. Most probably they are in an alternate dimension, or Wanda did her magics. I'm guessing the timeline was just before the Infinity war, or after Vision's death? I feel sorry for many laughable bombing reviews from haters that gave 1, 2, 3. Most probably are from brain damaged haters or DC fan boys. Well let me tell you this, still is so much better and entertaining than Wonder Woman 1984."
5 March 2021,Creative and charming but the pacing was dragged out and is a bit pandering. Feels like a filler that sets up a story we have still yet to see.,7.0,"ATTENTION -- MILD, MILD SPOILERS AHEAD:

We have seen the folks at Marvel go above and beyond to create their universe and we thought long were the days were they'd need to overexplain things to tell a great story. Everything about this show screamed psychic madness, magic extravaganza, fun old TV show callbacks and a dark storyline to deepen the character of Wanda; and yet we are left with a well-introduced engaging mystery that leads to what seems like a bland resolution to such an enticing premise.

I was aware Marvel would not risk telling a story that would shift the pieces of their expertly crafter universe right off the bat. But when they showed the weird teasers for WandaVision and knowing what I know about the character... It was on. I thought that after a huge event such as the Infinity Saga they'd go for a more ""down to earth"" story. However, comicbook fans that know what this story is (or was meant to be in the comics) and its relevance to not only the character of Wanda but many other characters Marvel has yet to introduce to the MCU...; would understand how this could have been a missed opportunity for that very purpose. And by saving it only at the very last minute (literally) doesn't make up for it.

Masking itself with tenderly family everyday-life TV callbacks to develop a much darker story of loss, the tones don't mix. The devastation of what happened with Thanos left a shockwave in the universe and one of the most affected person was Wanda. The outcome of this 9-episode story was too little to make this sitcom-runtime length of laughtracking bland episodes bearable. You cannot tell a dark story such as coping with death while trying to build a mystery surrounding a reality-altering story filled with TV references centering in humor. And not even funny humor but a charming quirky one that almost makes this show a Disney Channel Original. Not to mention the slap on the face it gives to fans of the character of the Scarlet Witch at the very end.

It reminds of the Civil War storyline adaptation. It was a great movie and well suited to the conflict that was brewing in the team, however the conflict set up was understandably ignored once Thanos came into play, leaving no lasting effect on the team; something which had the complete opposite effect on the comicbook storyline. I am aware these are ""adaptations"" and because of that they never meant to tell the same exact stories as in the comics. But I ask you, where do we draw the line between an adaptation faithful to the intent and purpose of the storyline it is adapting and the crafting of a completely knew one? When does the later changes so much as to become a new and different story masquerading as the old one but devoid of the same intent?

You all remember that Dumbledore scene in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, he wasn't angry in the books because it doesn't fit the character to get angry like that. Marvel Studios: you can make your own Marvel Universe with your own interpretations of the stories and characters, but mind the fact that if you want to pull them closer to their comicbook counterparts beware, at some point you'll be faced with a hard choice. Comicbooks have been and are still weird, and it's not surprising that some of the more lore-y stuff will not be apt for the average viewer. Not unless it's done properly. And again, so far the numbers have spoken: the audience can understand pretty messed up things. There's been some really conceptually complex stuff introduced in the MCU and so far everyone is on board, let's keep that up. Don't pander to the audience, don't treat them like dummies, we know what's up. Don't use 3 episodes to tell us that Wanda is in pain for the loss of Vision, that we already know. Tells us what she does about it in an uplifting heroic tale or let us wallow in her grief in a dramatic dark story, but don't try to mix both and expect a strong emotional reaction to both.

WandaVision had so so much potential, and it is receiving a 7 because this is not a bad show, not at all. THe story is engaging, the artistry and vision behind it, cinematography and narrative was engaging and original. It really did feel like you were watching and MCU movie. However, when you give a runtime of 9 episodes with a couple of them with more than a 30 minute runtime (not 38, because 7 minutes were for credits) it's a lot of minutes to tell more than what we actually had. I would have totally buyed into this ""going from sitcom era to sitcom era"" sort of storyline and perhaps dig more into those TV callbacks, however there were more storylines being told here and all of their tones were not juggled with very well.

And that was perhaps the biggest mistake people like me did. We were expecting too much of this show. I personally thought it would explain and introduce many concepts that could revolutionise the MCU, and in a way it did. But I asume it left out the best part for another occasion and that is playing with the expectations and, in my case, the patience of the audience. I am not going to watch 3 seasons of Frodo and Sam walking to Mordor. Extending the story will damage the pacing of it and that's a nono. Don't make us waste our time with slow narratives, these only work for deep and complex storylines that need pauses and silences to be impactful. Make short stories or make each episode be its own thing, have its own message, but if you are telling an overarching storyline WITH a mystery brewing, you need to give more. I really ended up finding onlt 30% of the chapter was actual substance, the rest was decor and presentation.

IN CONCLUSION, it's an interesting and engaging story that uses a very unique way to present its conflict. The cinematography is decent for a TV show and the characters, storyline and effects are well-realised. Not a bad first Marvel Studios TV show. We'll see what the rest of the shows have in store for us. I personally think this show was potentially one of the more interesting ones and it has been, I only hope the rest keep up the quality of this one. However, I will say that the pacing of the story was dragged by the runtime and that it mostly felt like a filler show, presenting characters that will play a bigger role in the future and with a big bombastic final showdown that lacked any stakes; and left almost no consequences to its outcome. Perhaps a too ""down to earth"" story after the epic Thanos time-travelling quest that changes the universe forever we had just witnessed. I guess anything now will look a bit bland in comparison. And at least this show had magic involved which is still uncharted territory to dig more into, I don't want to know about the rest of the shows. I guess time will tell."
30 January 2021,Actively Breaks The MCU Formula,8.0,"I got to say, I'm really impressed with WandaVision. From the trailers alone, I knew we were in for something new and I have yet to be disappointed. I love the MCU but admittedly, it has been getting a bit stale on me after watching a decade worth of movies with essentially the same formulaic structure. However, WandaVision has been rejuvenating my love for the MCU again because it goes out of its way to be different. The acting in this show is also really good too, with special shout-out to Elizabeth Olsen as the lead. This is her best portrayal of Wanda Maximoff yet and she provides so much range. This show is a slow-burner, so don't come in expecting standard Marvel action right away. The show is clearly building up to a bigger arc. Also, just a quick mention of the show being a homage to various sitcoms ranging from the 50s to the 70s, it is something I appreciate growing up as a Nick-at-Nite kid. Anyway, I'm looking forward to where the show is going to take us and right now, it's just nice to enjoy the ride."
8 March 2021,Surprisingly Excellent,8.0,"I was unsure in the first two episodes, but the next five were all fantastic! (The final two were good, but not my favourites).

I will admit the series does seem to require a decent knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (which would limit potential viewers), but the mystery being built and the sheer detail in planning required by the shows creators are masterful!"
26 January 2021,holy hell what a s***show,1.0,It was not funny. It had no super heros. It was not artsy. Just bad writing. Shot in 4:3 (you're literally watching the episode on half your TV set). Its just bad. Had to turn it off after 10 minutes.
5 February 2021,Waiting for more,10.0,
18 February 2021,Big thanks to my brother for making my watch this because...WOW,10.0,"So, my brother had forced me and my mom to watch this. (Neither of us really like marvel after what happened in Endgame) He said he wanted to see what all the hype was about.. (Just know that me and my mom had watched this and had to turn it off at episode 2 because of how bad it was) So we were watching because he was in control of the remote and slowly it started getting better and better around episode 3. AND MAN, WHEN WE GOT TO EPISODE 4. IT WAS ALL EYES ON THE TV. WOW IT WAS AMAZINGGGG. GEEZ. NOW IM SITTING HERE WAITING FOR THE NEXT EPISODE TO COME OUT ON FRIDAYYYY. P.S - The ads are sooo corny but what we slowly noticed is, most of them are hints."
15 January 2021,What is wrong with you people?!,8.0,"I read some reviews before watching the first episode and kinda got disappointed for I've been waiting a long time for this. However, when I watched it, I realized how stupid and ignorant some people are! I found in it everything everyone is claiming the show doesn't have; it is amusing and funny, and have a well defined path. It's so obvious that the show is not going to be this way to the end so why dont you just hang on to a 5 and then if you didn't like it by the end, give it your wrecking 1?

Seriously, just give things some time to prove themselves. If they couldn't, then go head and destroy them. It is too soon to judge its plot. It is so stupid to say it's not relevant to MCU and to call it rubbish only because you dont like its style.

I honestly dont know what the hell is the matter with you, hating everything you dont like. Understand the difference."
17 August 2021,Awesome,9.0,Great Series with every episode shows a different era of television.
17 December 2021,Watch the entire series before reviewing it!!!,10.0,Before you review it watch the entire series!! Every single one of reviews that gave it 1/10 were written the 15th of January meaning they that had only seen the first two episodes! The series evolves into a real marvel-like series full of suspense and action scenes that will blow you away. Wandavision is a work of art and you shouldn't review it if you haven't even watched half of it.
5 April 2021,Not so good. Not so bad,1.0,It could be better. I think marvel did mistake not working with N.
5 March 2021,WandaVision is a masterpiece,10.0,"This show is truly amazing. It builds up a lot for the next phase of the MCU. You get to see how Wanda really is and what she is capable of. This show shows exactly how strong Wanda is. We got to see how bad her life has been and how she found true love and lost it. The show has humor, action, emotions , a great story and some amazing characters. The show is full of twists and inside jokes. If you are an MCU fan and also a Comic fan, this will blow your freakin mind!

Trust me and watch at least the first 4 episodes until u judge the show, please!"
5 February 2021,Don't judge it by the episodes !,2.0,"A TV series must not be judged by its episodes, especially early ones, but by the intentions of its creators as explained by fan forums and social media recruited reviewers .

Hence, it's silly to call WandaVision a pretentious pile of garbage , with terrible story writing, incompetent screenplay, stereotypical characters played by mediocre actors .

Add a choice of presentation styles that not only are poorly executed, but seem to have been randomly chosen by an inexperienced marketing department with delusions of creative competence , while the production team was rolling their eyes .

But do not judge the content, just because that's what is shown in the first 5 episodes as of now - there is a bigger plan, it will all reveal itsself, and wasting your time now will have been worth it in the end .

Because that's how film making works - complete and utter garbage always turns into a magical experience , and content and competence are so overrated ."
7 March 2021,"I have no idea what is going on, but I am enjoying this so far!",8.0,"We started watching WandaVision last night and I am not a Marvel follower so, I have no idea who Wanda or Vision are, much to the chagrin of my wife and daughter. Based on my lack of Marvel world knowledge, I approached this show with an open mind and watched the first episode mildly annoyed because of the quirkiness factor it has. Usually, I tune out on quirky shows because they always feel forced to be weird just to be weird. A couple minutes into the first episode, I found myself being amused by the situations and feeling nostalgic because of the old school vibe I got from the tone of the show. We found ourselves laughing heartily at the situations Wanda and Vision were encountering. This was great, but what really grabbed my attention was the sinister undertones that began in the second episode. I began to feel uneasy because I truly have no idea what is going to happen, and I know there is a dark storyline that will become more apparent as I continue into this series. We are 3 episodes in and I am looking forward to continuing."
15 January 2021,Clever but nothing happened...,10.0,"Very clever idea and fun to watch but kinda didn't go anywhere over the 2 episodes which is an hour... imagine if nothing happened in a movie for that long...

I still have faith marvel will make this amazing but they better get a wriggle on."
15 January 2021,Not what you expect,2.0,"I have to say I had high hopes for something to watch that was action packed and entertaining, this show falls absolutely so flat on it's face. I have no clue where the 10s or even 9s come from after two episodes. They both were sooooo boring, did nothing to show us their abilities, have Vision scared of noises in the night, REALLY? The lead in to episode two was a hatchet job on the lead in to bewitch from the old days, don't know if any of you noticed that. I just don't find it entertaining as i would a MCU show. It's boring. I'll watch the next couple of episodes and see if it picks up, but if they next two are like the first two, I'd rather stab a pencil in my eyeball."
15 January 2021,Ouch!,1.0,"I just don't get it! I tried! I wanted to like it, but I couldn't make it thru the first show. First bar of 'Old MacDonald', and I was outta there!"
7 January 2022,Wanda fricking sucks,9.0,This show was amazingly written filmed and performed. But for the life of me I can't understand how the military were made out to be the bad guys. Wanda should have been shot and or imprisoned for at least 20 years. She has tortured people for months. Horrible torture. Chick is a more evil villain than Thanos good God. At least he thought he was helping the universe. Scarlet witch sucks. Great show though! Loved it.
19 March 2021,It was fine.,7.0,"They tried something new, and it worked. Good for them."
22 June 2021,"Great show, but you'll have to watch ALL of it!",8.0,"This is actually pretty interesting as a series. I didn't watch it for months, because the trailers made it look so ""50s"" and just looked - on the surface - to be trite.

It is not, and actually extremely good. It's akin to the Sixth Sense in that it tricks you into thinking it's one thing, but by the end, you find it's another. Very clever!

My initial pet peeve was simply this Wanda Maximoff was not, in the comic books telepathic nor telekinetic. Her name in the Marvel comics is The Scarlet Witch (a reference to her early appearances in Marvel, where her costume/outfit was scarlet in color). Wanda is a WITCH, and her powers would be called a ""Chaos Hex,"" akin to Murphy's Law: whatever CAN go wrong, WILL go wrong. She was originally part of Magneto's Brotherhood with her brother, Pietro (Quicksilver), but over the years developed into an extremely powerful Witch. So, this whole thing of changing her powers completely? Not a fan of it at all. And I have had to put that knowledge aside to watch this and not roll my eyes, but I really wish they hadn't changed her powers when she first appeared in the Avenger's movies during The Age Of Ultron. Magic is a pretty cool ability, so why jinx it? But, as I said, starts out as one thing and then it's another.

The further I got into the series, the better it got. So, now, 8 episodes in, it's up to an 9. If it were one of the first 4 episodes, it would be a 5, maybe a 6. As of the last episode, it rose to a 8. I have to say, the writing in the beginning would not have led me to believe I'd give it a 8 by the end. But, presto, change-o!

Now, after watching the entire season, I think it's great. Wanda changes, but I'm not giving away any surprises here. But by the end, it's an 8 for me. It improves with each episode, but you DO have to get past episode 4 before (even thinking about) rating it or you won't ""get it.""

As far as Wanda's powers, I have to revise my viewpoint (I wrote this review initially at episode 4, but fortunately, they haven't posted my review yet, so I had to rewrite it! ) As far as who she was in the comic books, I wasn't pleased with who she was in the Avengers - or even here.. But after the 6th episode (Halloween), you begin to see...nah, you'll have to see it for yourself. Clever surprise, that Halloween episode! Gotta give 'em points for that!

The best part is that Wanda morphs into herself, which you'll discover if you watch it all the way through. . Some minor flaws in the screenwriting in the final episodes, with the standard (but overly long) ""final showdown"" scenes (isn't that the downfall of any action-type movie? Nobody fights (and wins) in 5 or 10 minutes; it always has to last 40 minutes. Or more). And the acting is not exactly stellar throughout (Olsen spends most of her time with a pained, deer-caught-in-the-headlights facial expression). She does not have much range in her acting. And the character of Agatha Harkness is more a caricature than an actual character (she ""plays"" at being evil and witty, but doesn't truly pull it off)! And her laugh is a bit too fake to convince.

By the way, The actual character of Agatha Harkness, who first appeared in the Fantastic Four comic books around 1971 was a witch, too, but not evil. Still the stereotype remains in this series: the witch as a somewhat ""hag-like"" with overly sharp, ""pointy"" nose and features has been perpetrated, as in ""The Wicked Witch of the West"" type. Not necessary to pull off true ""evil."" But written into the script, nonetheless. Not a lot of imagination to this character.

Otherwise, a series that is better in the second half that the first half, and cleverer than it would originally appear. Nicely done."
16 January 2021,"Amazing Show, But Too Short.",9.0,"Such a charming show, that is so well researched and well made. So many little easter eggs. The only negative I have is the length of the episodes. The episodes are short enough as it is, then you realise that 6 minutes of what is already a short running time...is credits. Which is ridiculous. I don't know any other show that would waste 6 mins of good storytelling time on credits that Disney+ prompts you to skip anyway."
11 April 2021,This isn't your average marvel movie,10.0,"This is marvel taking the risk. Marvel be like screw it ""we doing sitcoms"" I wasn't convinced enough when I heard marvel wanted to make Wandavision a sitcom but I was wrong they nailed it on the dot with good writing and direction moving together with the good acting from Elisabeth, Paul, Teyonah Paris, Kathryn Hahn."
8 March 2021,"Good at the beginning and a dope concept, but overly complicated",5.0,"I love the concept of this show and it was cool, but as it went on it go more and more complicated. Now that I've seen the finale, I can tell you none of it made sense. I don't get why the MCU these days has to be just for the hardcore fans. Not of what I saw at the end made any sense, and it feels like I had to be taking notes to get it. Making your movies and tv shows just for hardcore fans is just bad business."
19 March 2021,Slow Burn,8.0,"The first time I tried to watch this show I got precisely 14 mins into episode one and thought what is this pile of **** and turned it off.

Months later my sister of all people (she's not that into super hero's) said I should push through and keep going, it gets better she said. So today I carried on from where I left off and I got to the end of the first episode and had my previous thoughts confirmed it's trash. Still with my sisters praise still ringing in my ears I thought ok lets see episode 2 TLDR still trash.

By the end of episode 4 however things turn around and the end of the season is nothing short of EPIC.

Stop reading about it and go and watch it, I was wrong at the start you will be too watch it until the end the pay off is worth it :D"
12 February 2021,This is awesome!!,10.0,
4 May 2021,Don't really understand the hype.,1.0,"The first 3 episodes are really junk. The next 4 are really rushed. The villain is weak. The plot is pale. You (or just me) doesn't really feel connected to characters except for Wanda & Vision due to us being used to them in Avengers and it is rated 8. But the other show, The Falcon And Winter Soldier has character development, an actual plot, very good reasoning, motives for each character and still rated around 7. I think this show is garbage that just ran on Marvel brand. Take it off and it is just some high school kid who shot the show on budget that is way over the top. I really don't understand the hype.."
16 January 2021,IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS,10.0,"How dare people come to this app and leave a negative 1 star review bashing a show that has had 2 episodes? We are finally getting something creative, something different, from the MCU. The first two episodes are a delight! My mom and dad laughed through the whole thing with me, and the actors are lovely.

You can tell this is going to be a long unfolding journey, and the mystery surrounding what's happening is anyone's speculation. It's brilliant.

Watch with an open mind and open heart and I guarantee you'll get real enjoyment from this"
16 January 2021,From someone who used to watch Nick at Night,,"If you are one of those kids that just randomly started watching Nick at night couple decades back, then you know what I'm talking about. Don't expect an avengers infinity war or endgame type theatrics. I honestly think this is like putting a puzzle together. There are a lot of moments where I think this is setting up a much bigger build up. I know there will be a link to the Doctor Strange multi-verse of madness. Don't jump to conclusions. Phase 4 just began. Enjoy it!"
21 May 2021,Very strange but addictive!,7.0,Started really weird and I had no idea where it was going but went along for the ride. The production value kept me hooked and the whole mystery of what is going on almost lost its edge until episode 7 where the cliff hanger really got me! Binge the show - it's worth a watch and helps get you through the lack of marvel movies during the pandemic.
6 February 2021,Dont judge the series on initial 3 episodes.....there is so much more ahead,10.0,Its an 8/10 but i am giving a 10 to improve the overall rating of the show
12 February 2021,Don't listen to bad reviews - absolutely FANTASTIC,10.0,"We watched episode 1 & 2 and were a little 'whaaaaat' but picked up on the subtle elements that hint at what is to come. It is such an intriguing and well done series which keeps you guessing. We look forward to every Friday to watch this, which is a bit like when you were a kid watching a sitcom! So clever."
18 January 2021,Think star wars but for your cousin,9.0,If you've ever put both shoes on the wrong foot that's this i mean. This show had no accuracy but not for a lack of aim. Wandavision is just their names. I pre fer wanda and cosmo of the oddparents . Respectfully
19 March 2021,Beyond dire! Then...,8.0,"So many seemed to be kidding themselves about this drivel, but once you've gotten through the dreadfully written and unfunny sitcom gag (that runs longer than really necessary), the third episode finally kicks in where only the very few clues of previous episodes had hinted at."
28 February 2021,Soooooo good.,9.0,First 3 episodes are a bit of a pain but good things are worth waiting for. This is absolutely fantastic made and the only criticism I got is I wish it was longer ;) such a great show.
14 June 2021,It's alright,6.0,"I do commend Marvel for wanting to try something new rather than sticking to their formula we've seen with their movies in the past decade. However, this show is very mediocre. It gets off to a strong start, but the last two or three episodes are very lackluster and ultimately unfulfilling. There are a ton of plot holes, and with no season two in sight, I doubt they will be explained. Somewhat enjoyable."
6 February 2021,Extremely interesting series,,Starts a little bit weird but if you stay until the end it turns amazing. Episodes 4 and 5 were just incredible
8 March 2021,"Great show, has it's own story whilst connecting with the wider MCU...",,"I've seen some reviews that say this is for hardcore MCU fans only. I'm a moderate fan, I love MCU (mostly) but I'm not married to it. As a average viewer I completely enjoyed the show. It's not a cinematic masterpiece (not least of all because it's a TV show) but it brings something new and refreshing to the MCU. The show dropped enough cliffhanger fairy dust into each episode to keep me coming back for more. There's nothing worse than sequels that have nothing to do with the originals or to a lesser extent sequels that don't tie into any aspect or their former or latter movies/shows. MCU connects things together nicely and gets me excited about future releases.

I came as a curious viewer, I left as a fan."
16 January 2021,Best new series streaming right now!,10.0,"UPDATE: After 6 episodes, the major story developments make this show the best new series streaming right now. The storytelling is creative, imaginative and utterly enjoyable. I completely disagree with the negative reviews that say those that gave this show a high rating just have faith that Marvel Studios will eventually give us a big payoff near the end. I'm actually not a huge MCU fan, but I have enjoyed this show from the very start. I do think that those who gave this show a 1 or 2 review just don't get it. This unique show is brilliantly crafted, clever and fun. I can't wait until Friday when Disney releases the next installment.

I'm amazed by the number of 1 and 2-star ratings. Such low ratings should be reserved for shows that are utterly unwatchable...which this show is not. Quite the opposite. I found it to be a high-quality show that was well-scripted, well acted, very watchable and in keeping with Marvel's brand of entertainment.

The first two installments tell us very little about what it really going on. And, that's the point. They each take a common sitcom plot line (entertaining the boss and his wife for dinner, for example), and weave in hints that not everything is what it seems. Presented with lead protagonists who are enchanting and exude warmth, I want to know why they are there, stuck in a 50's or 60's sitcom, and I can't wait to find out."
15 January 2021,Not perfect but a promising start to phase 4,8.0,Phase 4 is here and while I'm not big on sitcoms. I like the blend of humor and weirdness it balances it very well. It's in no way perfect but it's a very promising start.
19 January 2021,I think this show is some kind of genius.,8.0,"Don't get me wrong, this show is bat**** insane in its idea and execution, but it's also kind of genius. It's both an actual sitcom AND traps the viewer in some kind of Truman Show / Shutter Island parallel narrative that we're only partially privy to. I was super skeptical about it and I've honestly been a little super-heroed out recently, but I absolutely love this show."
15 January 2021,What the hell is this? Another Disney disaster,1.0,"Yes, I've only seen two episodes and yes I realise the premise is based on I Love Lucy crossed with Bewitched. Just one problem, those two shows were brilliant and funny. This series is a heap of rubbish and tries to be something that it will never be... a classic American Sitcom. To be fair I will give another couple of episodes a chance, it to keep me beyond that the show needs to pull a miracle, which sadly I don't think it will be able to deliver. Yet again Disney has failed dismally with established cannon."
5 May 2022,The one where feelings show up,9.0,"I've started the MCU saga 2 months ago and I'm watching the contents in the order of release. Feelings and emotions are not really the main topic of this kind of movies/series, and I'm ok with that.

WandaVision, however, does something different: that's the one missing in the MCU.

The first 3 or 4 episodes might be confusing, but as soon as you get what is possibly going on, empathising with Wanda is easy.

The last 2 episodes were amazing, I felt all her feelings as they were mine (Elisabeth Olsen was great). I hope I'll find more contents in the MCU like this one.

9/10 totally deserved!"
30 January 2021,When creativity gets the production $ it needs...,10.0,"Do you have any idea how hard it is to find content this original, covering this kind of material, with this level of production value? That alone puts this show in the 8/10 range. The only reason somebody would rate this less than 8 is if they haven't followed marvel. After 4 episodes I give it an 8.3/10. How it ends will determine whether that score goes up or down. Unbelievably good stuff."
5 March 2021,Series Review: Nice Little Gem with a few flaws,7.0,"Having just watched the Series Finale I was left with a satisfying ending to an overall nice story outline. Starting the show with the first episodes in that nostalgic while parodic manner was a very amusing way to hook the audience with little to no information about the grand scheme of things. Felt a bit like watching TV from back then whilst reading a mystery book. However, it went a bit off the rails when more and more information got to the viewer and some decisions seemed a bit lazily written without enough imagination. And especially this show had the perfect premise to go bonkers. For instance the villainous characters felt one dimensional or even unnecessary. The emotional ending saved the show however since it tied together the messages the show wants to convey. All in all a nice little show with some really nice ideas, moments and overall message unfortunately sprinkled with underwhelming writing at times."
22 March 2021,Mavel's Future is Looking bright!!!,8.0,"As this is the first MCU entry in phase four, as well as the first MCU property to come out since Spider Man: Far From Home, a year and a half. When the first two episodes came out, i was hyped, and i was surprised to see Marvel try something new, and it was entertaining to watch. Then episode 3 came out and raised more questions. Now, episode 4 was some of that Marvel charm we come and loved to know for over ten years, thou it eventually came to the downfall of its popularity. Personally, I loved all of it, and I didn't believe any of the fan theories and took it on it's own story, a story about Wanda dealing with her past and all her pain and lost. People didn't like the finale because some of their theories didn't come true, but really, this is the start of phase 4, i did not expect some Luke Skywalker moment. It was a fun start to an ever growing universe, and excited to see where we go next in falcon and winter solider."
8 February 2021,I didn't review before 4th episode,10.0,As usual Marvel Studio doesn't fail us to surprise. I didn't judge the whole series just on 2 episode. it's great Loved it.
1 August 2022,"Creates Deep Wonder, with a Magical Vision.",8.0,
23 January 2021,What is this cr@p?!?!,3.0,"If I wanted to watch old black and white comedy shoes, I'd watch ""I Love Lucy"". At least that show was funny. What's the purpose of having a MCU show with no action or excitement? I mean really, this is just an old burn out sitcom with a little flair. Bring on the fire and brimstone that other MCU movies and shows had! At least Arrow, Flash, and the DC Universe had action. I'm mad because this show woke me up and I needed sleep. And as for those saying ""Why rate the whole series and not the episodes"", it's because I couldn't make it past the first two episodes. I think I'm going to drop my Disney+ and just buy into it when the Mandalorian comes out with new seasons."
30 January 2021,....and then comes the 4th episode. Woohooo,9.0,"The series starts slow....the first episode is designed exactly like a sitcom from the 60s, the second starts to give some clues, but still nothing fast paced, but has decent humour, then the 3rd episode is sort of clumsy but gets really interesting after about 20 mins it and things start getting very intriguing and interesting.... And then comes the 4th episode!!! This episode is what gets this series a near perfect rating. Now once you watched the 4 episode you are now on the edge....but the biggest grouse is that the credits are loooooong almost over 5 mins.

Desperately waiting for the 5th episode and what follows."
12 April 2021,A Great Start to Phase Four!,9.0,"This is a very good and well thought-out start to the MCU's phase four. First of all, the premise and idea of this show is amazing and I don't know how they thought of it. Another thing this show has running for it is an amazing cast that work really well together, a compelling villain in Agatha Harkness, and very well writing. Overall, this is a great start to phase four.

EDIT: The Ralph Bohner situation was stupid and annoying in my opinion.

9.2/10."
5 March 2021,I'm lost for words...,5.0,"After finishing wandavision, I can now say that it was so average. Marvel normally get things right, apart from a few movies they made.

They tried to make the show different which is fine, but the first 4 episodes were very boring and pointless. We get that Wanda is living in her world but did we need 4 episodes of how she's living life?

It's very slow and pointless up until the point they start showing what's actually going on outside of her world.

Marvel fans such as myself are realistic and truthful but unfortunately most of the positive reviews are from marvel fans that never see any wrong in what marvel makes."
12 March 2021,"Up and Down, Up and Down",9.0,
18 March 2021,Especially good for couples,9.0,"I recommend to couples, in love to follow. The couple for the most part. It is a good mini series, very good quality special effects, good story, good dialogue, good acting. Stay tuned, my rating for WandaVision is 8. Once again, I recommend watching it with your girlfriend / wife / partner will be much more enjoyable with your loved one."
7 March 2021,They ruined the series with that ending,1.0,We can forgive all the crafted hype but not the thing they do with Evan Peters...
16 December 2021,Not one laugh (for me) in 2 1/2 episodes,2.0,"In all fairness, I watched only 2 1/2 episodes. I didn't laugh once, despite all the uproarious laughter on the laugh track telling me to; nor did I find the massive abundance of Bewitched tricks appealing. I watched this because of all the accolades. I have FOMO, but in this case, I am glad to be spending my time elsewhere. In all fairness, I saw the originals of what this is trying to copy. It's ersatz. (Google it.) Watch the real thing! They are truly funny."
22 January 2021,Painfully unfunny and a story cul-de-sac,6.0,"There's probably about 2 minutes of actual content in each episode that matters.

I don't quite get everyone preaching it's genius. It's surface level stuff with it just mimmicking sitcoms from the era but the difference is they were funny.

Don't understand the hype."
5 March 2021,You can pass this hype-train also,6.0,"I can only guess to the reasons why, but my two best cracks at the mystery here follow as these:

1. people actually like this cookie-cutter soap-opera formula juxtaposed to the cheesy melodrama of superheroes (which to me must be counted among the worst in the field of melodrama) 2. people just like Wandavision because other people told them so on various social platforms, and a slew of people are nigh completely ruled by peer pressure when forming personal taste.

In short, if you don't like soap-opera, pointless melodrama, corny, campy, on-the-nose arm-chair psychology, then avoid. This is coming from someone who can get down with Whedon's early stuff, I am not completely outside their target-audience.

This is my review 8 episodes in, the finale needs to pull an heroic effort to make me reconsider. I am glad Disney took a chance at something like this, I just hope they rinse and repeat with a better project next time.

+2 for Elisabeth and Paul and +1 for an original, but ultimately stupid, idea."
5 March 2021,A semi-entertaining series but lacks substance in the overall story,4.0,"After finally watching all 9 episodes there are some key things I'd like to point out. The first two episodes were really disappointing but after watching the 3rd episode things made more sense. The show definitely got better after that and there have been some really interesting story lines. It was nice to see Wanda have a full character arch. Vision and pretty much all of the other characters were really well acted and very interesting. Each episode was very interesting and left me wanting more. The finale was a real disappointment as it fell short of giving the series an interesting and conclusive end. There were a lot of plot points to tie up and the show really disappointed and sort of lazily tried to wrap the show up but still tying WandaVision to the new Dr. Strange movie (coming in 2022).

Unfortunately there were a lot of problems (in my opinion). This being Marvel Entertainment's first Disney+ series (I'm not counting Marvel Television as it was not run directly with Marvel & the MCU) it was really not what would be expected from a multi episode tv series . Each episode did not feel like it was really well connected and sort of lacked a typical beginning, middle and end that most tv series (and movies) have. Each episode is about 40 minutes long and that includes about 8 minutes of beginning and end credits. So each episode we got about 32 minutes of story. Looking back it really seems more like a movie story setup and they just divided it into 9 episodes (would be actually about 4 hours). Each episode did have its own theme but it really lacked structure in each episode. You can watch shows like Jessica Jones, Legion, and Agents of Shield and see that each episode has its own story and is not just simply connected to the overall series/franchise.

There were a lot of expectations from fans and I would recommend not getting too caught up in some of the Fan theory/ Easter egg videos online as you will be even more disappointed with the finale. I think Marvel could've included some more cameos/characters to help clear somethings up. To me this show seemed kind of like Captain Marvel in the way that it really is mostly trying to setup future Marvel properties and characters and have some fun storylines without having to do much work. I hope this show is not going to be the ""standard"" for future Marvel Disney+ shows and Movies. It had a great opportunity to bring in some interesting characters and storylines but it did not give much substance to the characters or to the story and left the audience without much closure."
1 May 2021,"Dull, feeble and very boring",1.0,"Almost the entire first four episodes are a I love Lucy remake which is painful and cringy. They try and justify this with blatant hints about something else going on, which, if you know about Scarlet Witches powers is obvious.

It lumbers on to a disappointing end. I am bemused at how so many people are obsessed with it. The acting (except for Paul Bettany) is tragic and the plot is clunky and convoluted."
13 February 2021,Star Wars needs to learn from this story writing,8.0,If only Kathleen Kennedy had this kind of people to write the sequel trilogy we would be fine. This has a real plot behind it and it's paying off. The mandalorian compared to this show is a joke.
8 March 2021,First two episodes vs the rest of the show,10.0,The first two episodes are boring... I thought about not continuing the show Starting from episode 3 you realize why there was this build up A nice show and an introduction to a cinematic universe Elizabeth olsen is pretty and the story is captivating..
5 March 2021,👎🏻,1.0,"I am a fan of marvel movies and I was sure that the series would have been a success but watcher beware, this is one of the most boring and and failed series I have ever seen and I'm not exaggerating .... this is a series for the inexperienced viewer who doesn't have standards or can differentiate from other shows..... with two words JUST AWFUL. I was expecting more from MARVEL"
27 July 2021,Fantastic Show that just fell a little flat at the end.,8.0,"For starters Wandavision is definitely unique within the Marvel universe. Marvel usually plays its movies ""safe"", but definitely takes some creative risks here. The only criticism I would give would be that the finale falls a little flat. Overall still very good."
15 January 2021,What were they smoking,3.0,What was Disney thinking when they Commissioned. Really bad caned laughter horrendous script writing and it's going nowhere. The first episode gave us nothing towards the story line and at 22 minutes long was very short.
8 October 2021,A Great Examination of Grief and Loss Through Superhero as well Classic TV Lense,9.0,"Watched WandaVision with Elizabeth Olsen(Godzilla,Avengers:Age Of Ultron) as Wanda Maxmimoff/Scarlet Witch, Paul Bettany(Solo:A Star Wars Story) as Vision ,Teyonah Parris(If Beale Street Could Talk) as Monica Rambeau,Randall Park(Ant-Man And The Wasp) as Agent Jimmy Woo,Kat Dennings(Thor:The Dark World) as Darcy Lewis ,Josh Stamberg(J. Edgar) as Tyler Hayward And Kathryn Hahn(We're The Millers,Tommrowland) as Agatha Harkness.

As someone who has had family pass away recently this show was great at examining the five stages of Grief as wanda is trying live in her personal bubble after the loss of vision and post-endgame consequences denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The series does a great job of going through during its seasons run from Classic TV to Modern Television i was hoping for season 2 i honestly dont think Doctor Strange And The Mutliverse With Give a Chance for Wanda Maxmimoff to shine like she did in her mini-series despite getting second Billing to The Doctor Strange. A Great Examination of Grief and Loss Through Superhero as well Classic TV Lense

Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen) and Awesome Showrunning By Jac Schaffer(Timer) & Matt Shankman(Heroes Reborn) A Great Examination of Grief and Loss Through Superhero as well Classic TV Lense 9/10."
7 February 2021,Fallen in love with it since Episode 1,10.0,"I've already fallen in love with it since Episode 1. It was a brave thing Marvel did, making a story that is a slowburn yet able to contain the mystery, spreading tiny bits of anomaly gradually, a totally different approach compared from all they had offered before. I love it! This is one of those shows that I was so excited to check every week. A beautiful character examination of Wanda, who was once just sidelined as a supporting character with every Marvel movie she had been part of before--now the main focus. And she definitely shines in this one! I know it's still too early to say this, but this is already the best series of 2021! I claim it."
27 February 2021,Mediocre at best. Ignore the fanboys giving perfect scores,5.0,"This show is mediocre at best. There was so much hype about this show but it falls flat. They try hard to connect it all together to Avengers Endgame and Captain Marvel but that's where it feels forced and fails. This show is perfect form of mediocrity, it's passable but it's something you can only watch it once. The premise of the show is good but the potential is totally lost. The story drags on forever till episode 5 and nothing of importance happens. I hope at least something more mature and worthy comes out of Disney in the future."
17 March 2021,Wonderful and incredible,10.0,"A wonderful series, full of brilliant and interesting characters, I was very excited about each episode."
24 February 2021,Not perfect but entertaining and intersecting,9.0,Great show mostly due to Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany. The first few episodes are kind of slow but it picks up around the 4th episode. The best way I can describe it is a standard marvel movie mixed with the genre episodes of Community. To be honest Monica is kind of bland but the actress for her does a much better job than the actress of Maria from captain marvel. Randall Park as jimmy woo is the best character by far. Now it's looking like it might go over the top with this Agatha stuff but I'm hoping they can pull it off.
16 February 2021,The Magnum Opus of MCU,10.0,"It took a lot of time for me to start watching this show, but jeez is it good! I was hooked from the first episode. It is funny and wholesome at first, while presenting a dark and sinister tone. And at last we get to see more of Vision and Wanda who is portrayed by great actors. The show is not afraid to move away from the blockbuster formula, becoming less mainstream and becoming better. It's not something you can watch casually after having watched a few Avengers movies.This could possibly be the best thing out of the MCU ever."
6 August 2021,Marvel with No Vision,1.0,"One of the absolute worst series in da modern era. I still have no clue wtf was going on.

Direction is poor and the cast is 'no one really cares'!"
27 July 2021,"Good, but not best",8.0,"Some wasted potentials that could've been included:
X-Men (i.e. ""certain"" Maximoff)
Dr. Strange


The earlier episodes are intriguing and good. Classic TV Shows style and such.

The alternate-bad-guy is too comical and so out-of-character for someone in such higher-up position.

Aside from those nagging, it's a must watch for MCU fans."
5 July 2021,Descent into mediocrity,5.0,"""WandaVision"" started out strong and full of promise. Interesting set-up and premise, the cast seemed to be on point...but much like the other Disney Plus Marvel releases so far, it ended up being a disappointment. Despite a solid start, it began an inevitable slide into mediocrity, one the show couldn't ultimately shake. I doubt I'll ever watch it again, which is pretty sad given the wasted potential, the production values and insanely high budget.

Honestly, as I'm almost reluctantly making my way through these Disney Plus Marvel series...I just don't think they are worth investing any time in! One thing is becoming abundantly clear, canceling and almost erasing the Marvel TV universe previously built by Jeph Loeb and co., including the Netflix-Marvel collaborations and ABC Studio productions (with the exception of ""Inhumans""), was premature and ultimately a mistake."
5 March 2021,Great!!,9.0,
7 March 2021,A fair review,6.0,
16 January 2021,For those complaining about ratings...,3.0,"First off, your average MCU fan will not like this series. Namely because there is no hook. There is a vague mystery, but nothing that grabs you from the first two episodes. I can already say this will be the most polarizing thing in the MCU Disney+ catalog, and were off to a rocky start. Thats not to say its decently written, for what it is, but after the first 2 episodes its just not interesting. Overall, it is a play on old TV tropes, as you have seen written so far. The pacing and episode length though cause it to be lackluster. For those complaing about early reviews, you absolutely can apply them. The series will lose a lot of people for its blaze premise and lack of action. Those are just the facts. That said, when the series is complete, I'm certain a binge session would probably look on this more favorably. Unfortunately the writing and pace dont compell me to watch right when it drops. Watching when the whole series is released will probably make the viewing better."
15 January 2021,Very good,10.0,Really entertaining first episode looking forward to the rest of the season
2 February 2021,"Watch ""Batman Soul of The Dragon (2021)"" instead, it's more interesting to watch : )",,"The overly used formula of canned laughter, cheesy mixture of the B&W ""I Love Lussie"" bimbo shows together with ""I Dream of Jeannie"" tingling magic shows, all predictably and inevitably with similar exaggerated idiotic dialog, bad acting, cartoon-effect soundtrack that identically used as the must-have ingredients so contrite only in those old-school shallow farces, all faithfully jammed into this 1st episode. It has successfully drove me away in no time to have the guts to maintain my interests or curiosity to watch on. Every minute of it only gave me roll-in-the-eyes headaches. Don't care if this TV drama might gradually evolve into a more interesting and watchable show, time on this planet is becoming shorter and shorter, no time to waste in gamble and false hope. Adios!"
17 January 2021,"So far, so good. Just good though.",8.0,"WandaVision's gotten off to a good start so far, but I'm waiting for the later chapters to see how this thing plays out on more dramatic levels. The sitcom twist is a nice touch as is the reality-altering plot of the series, but we can't judge it fully based on the first two episodes alone.

Guys, we should do what we did with Watchmen: wait it out and don't review-bomb it unnecessarily (that was stupid last time and it's still stupid now, so please don't add to that toxicity).

I'm hoping the series delivers something akin to The Mandalorian: giving us a new take on something we thought we knew inside-and-out. What the Mandalorian did for Star Wars is what I'm hoping WandaVision does for the MCU; but who knows?

Just wait until the whole thing's been released on Disney+ And THEN do your complete reviews on the series."
22 April 2021,Wandvision is a Great Ride,9.0,
8 June 2021,Absolutely terrible,1.0,"Mind numbing to say the very least. This show has to be one of the worst I have EVER stuck with. I simply watched it until the end because I was told it would get better after the first three episodes. It did not get any better at all, in fact, it got worse and more and more boring. Painful to watch and being a big fan of Marvel movies this was hugely disappointing."
17 January 2021,Exactly what it's trying to do,9.0,"Only 2 episodes in and I'm very intrigued. This show is doing exactly what it's trying to do. They have nailed the 50's time piece even down to the laugh track and style of humor. This isn't supposed to be funny. It's very obviously 50's comedy so it's very outdated and that's the point. If you have ever watched any tv shows from this era (which I think is probably the biggest problem for these low reviews) you would see this quite plainly. Kevin Feige and Marvel know exactly what they are doing any they are doing it flawlessly. For those that are hating it, your loss. Go watch DC if you aren't satisfied with the amount of explosions."
21 February 2021,What kind of crack are people smoking?,1.0,
17 January 2021,"Just A Comic Show, No Marvel Heros",6.0,"Plot: nonsense. This is just a comic show with two great Marvel heroes that act like silly. Can't bear this. Marvel is sinking, definitely."
18 January 2021,"Worst start possible , gets interesting",4.0,"When you find out how big the budget is for this show , which is around 20 million an episode , this carbon copy it bewitched is pretty disappointing, however the 2nd ep does get a little interesting and seems like some real comic book stuff are coming . All these people calling it a masterclass and all that are pure clowns the first ep was a complete waste of my time , 2nd however interesting and you're like okay something is coming , but with a budget as much as a movie it better get better ."
17 March 2021,Watched Every episode. This is junk.,1.0,"I am a marvel fan but that doesn't mean you can feed me any junk and expect me to keep mum. With so many annoying characters straight out of B-grade teen movies this is indeed a sign of Marvel's downfall content wise. Were the makers high while sitting for discussion of the story? Seriously this series makes no sense. First 3 episodes try to deceive audience that this is some Marvel's experiment gone wrong. In order to justify this the rest of the episodes tries to connect the first 3 episodes but fails miserably. The characters Darcy Lewis, Agnes and Monica Rambeau were super annoying or pathetic to be precise. These are the B-grade teen movie characters I mentioned earlier. The story is dumb. The CG was awful. Trying to bring in Quicksilver from X-men was pointless and pure gimmick to pull audience. If Marvel takes audience for granted and if the audience keep supporting these low-grade junk by dancing to Marvel's tunes then consider me out for Phase 4. Losing an audience a day will keep away the Marvel's cash register from ringing one day."
3 November 2021,Wish it hit harder,8.0,
25 April 2021,Just wow,10.0,"The first few episodes are dreadful, but let me tell you when the show picks up it was worth it suffering through those couple of episodes."
17 January 2021,"Maybe, Maybe not",6.0,
17 January 2021,Refreshing and Pure Brilliance,10.0,"Taking a risk and leaving the constant structure of most of the MCU, WandaVision is beyond refreshing. Just in the first two episodes you're given stellar, amazing performances by Olsen and Bettany, intriguing mystery, and an incredible homage to classic television. It's pure brilliance! Can't wait to see what's next."
15 August 2022,ICONIC AND IMPECCABLE,10.0,
19 January 2021,"Whatever you're trying to do,it doesn't work yet",3.0,"Turning Avengers into a 50's sitcom might be the new idea, but these 2 episodes doesn't work.It's not exciting nor fun in anyway.I think I'm kind to give them 3/10. I just hope that 3rd episode will be better. Now I'd.rather watch I love Lucy or Bewitch hahaha."
16 January 2021,Amazing,8.0,I know only 2 episodes have been released but i like that its not the classic marvel fights everywhere and disney took a different turn with this im just wanting the rest of the season to release
15 January 2021,This one probably should have been releashed as a season.,8.0,"I was really excited by this title and I still am, ALTHOUGH I just watched two episodes of the show and I'm a bit at a loss. I'm not scratching my head as to what happened, I like being puzzled, but I am not yet sure if the first two episodes really add up to anything and I am afraid of how that is going to translate to the series as a whole. Don't get me wrong, I adore the concept, but I feel that I watched a standalone story with only a fraction of what might be the actual story. I got really excited at first only to feel a bit bored later. It needed more excitement, thrills and/or mystery. Or such a slow and (pardon me for saying this) monotonous beginning should have been releashed as a whole, in order to offer the whole colourful and multilayered experience we have all been waiting for (and I bet we will get by the end). For the reasons I explained, I believe it didn't leave a nice taste to a good amount of people. This is definitely not the next ""Mandalorian"" for Disney+, but I am glad they are taking risks and pushing the boundaries that we came to expect for a superhero medium. I hope the show finds its footing soon so it won't just feel like a special. High hopes, still. *EDIT* Just watched the third episode. And I, still, stand by my words. We're getting there, but slowly. I insist that it would be a more pleasant experience as a binge, because I still feel I watched nothing essential. *EDIT* EPISODE 4 WAS GREAT!"
12 February 2021,A New Breed Of TeleVision Series,10.0,"As I start the series is in the mid-season already, they said that the series is slow at the start because of the sitcom style of presenting the characters but it is part of the plot and the story. They cannot do a big jump on the first episode because they can leave us on the top hanging and waiting for another surprise on the upcoming episodes. We just need to wait and see the true colors of this MCU series.

The characters mainly Wanda Maximoff and The Vision is having a tremendous amount of effort because they are not used to be at their performance in this series. They need to act with an old-style to fit into the era they are portraying with. Please do not forget this is Science Fiction because this is not only in the 70s or 90s. We just need to wait until this series came to an end and we can properly rate this.

ps. This a partial review of the series. Thank you"
16 January 2021,The satire got old quickly,5.0,"Once you look deeper into trying to pass off superheroes as real, struggling people, it gets stupid. The opening is in the 50s era in black and white (which is fine) and Vision is just a plain joe trying to blend into the neighborhood. How is Vision going to compete against other human beings for a job? OMG, I just don't know. He only has 100 times the productivity. But he's still working his way up. OK, let's get beyond that and try to have fun. For a 5 minute look without anything else, it would have been OK. But a half hour retrospect to a slapback 50s sitcom, complete with forced laughtrack?

Even the biggest fan in the room was waiting for it to pull back out and go into the story. But it kept on going for the full half hour. It's like the 5 minute comedy sketch that was great for 5 but at 7-9 minutes, has long worn out its welcome. Now it was very, very well done satire. Which is why I'll give it a 5 - and a very generous 5. But this is just exploitation. Pack it up. Think of something new."
21 February 2021,Classic marvel,8.0,"The early episodes worked for me - just really funny and well written, like a good comedy. Then things gradually turn mysterious and slowly get darker and more engaging plot-wise. If this is a taste of what marvel tv is going to be then we've got a lot to look forward to."
14 July 2022,The Wizard of Oz,8.0,
12 June 2021,A lot of reviews don't get it,8.0,"First thing to say; this is not a comedy. Yes, it pays homage to classic sitcom styles, but from the very first episode there are hints that something more is going on here, and by episode 4, we are back in typical Marvel storytelling.

If you watch this expecting a wacky comedy based around Marvel characters, you're going to be disappointed. If you watch this expecting classic Marvel action, and give up after 2 episodes, you're going to be disappointed. If you stick with it, you get a great continuation of the MCU.

For me, this was some of the best character development we have seen from Marvel, and the first time we have seen some of the fallout from Infinity War/Endgame. It was a moving, emotional story, exploring themes such as loss, grief, and depression in an interesting and creative way.

We also get some returning minor characters, and the introduction of a potential new Avenger, so there's a lot in there if you're a long time fan of the MCU."
14 February 2021,Brilliant...Absolutely brilliant,10.0,"I cannot say it enough - this show is absolutely brilliant.

At first it seemed slow. But, only one re-watch in and its obvious that even the first few episodes are fantastic. Blink and you'll miss it stuff. Truly a goldmine of clues, Easter eggs, suspense, mystery, and all the good stuff.

The dialogue is so thought out and deliberate. This is what story telling should be. The costumes, sets and designs looks great. The acting superb. I particularly enjoy the inclusion of Kat Dennings and Randall Park. Who I hope will both be included in more of the Marvel universe offerings."
29 June 2021,WELL DONE.,8.0,"The show started off well with the buildup of an interesting mystery with strong performances. The pacing was a bit slow at times but it was satisfying to see the plot and the characters unravel as we started to get a picture what was going on. I loved the villain being emotion, but she has literally no motivation and just wanys power. Another CGI fight scene in the ending but that's fine."
22 July 2021,From what's going on? to OMG Whats next ?,10.0,"Yes, the first 2 episodes are slow and they made it look like SITCOM for a reason. After that there is no turning back. Incredible acting and score and the screenplay is super tight. This one got one of the best Marvel Villains.

Ending sequence with DR STRANGE theme is exciting and chilling."
12 March 2021,"good start, poor finish",6.0,"Series were really well made in first 5 eps, however later it turns into stupid boring final.. if you build a tension you should have a good climax but finish here was really bad. 7 for wanda vision character fans, 5 for others"
29 January 2021,Yessss,10.0,I stayed up for 28 hours just to watch the new episode when it premiered. I love Scarlet Witch! (And Vision)
18 January 2021,"The good reviews must be based on expectations for the Future, not what we see in Ep 1&2",2.0,
16 January 2021,Very watchable.,10.0,"I won't give anything away, but I'm not even a big superhero fan and I already love this show."
8 March 2021,The Daenerys Targaryen we never had,8.0,
3 March 2021,do you remember breaking bad?,9.0,"People watched breaking bad season 1 & 2, and they hated it .. breaking bad wasn't so much famous with these two seasons. but then they watched 3 & 4 & 5 and it simply was the best tv show in the world. and also when they came back and watched 1 & 2 the understood and they loved it. this is how wandavision works. don't judge the whole show based on the first two episodes. patience, the next is gonna impress you. and when you watch the first after that you will understand."
6 March 2021,Best series I've ever seen,10.0,"It was a series I was unsure about, but it turned out to be one of the best things Marvel have ever done. The tonal shifts, the mystery, the acting, and most of all the connection to the comics. Elizabeth Olsen is incredible, one of the best performances I've ever seen. It is the best possible start to phase 4, and a better follow up to endgame than I could have ever imagined. Perfect series, start to end."
9 August 2022,If stranger things came to marvel,10.0,
6 March 2021,Really Good Show But the End Was a Bit of a Let Down,9.0,
8 February 2021,Bad programming,1.0,"Why spend 3 episodes on an awkward 50ties style of comedy setting right at the start? They should have made these episodes in the middle or to the end of a season. Anybody casually checking out this series will be disappointed, when it turns into a superhero flick and anybody getting to the show expecting a superhero flick is disappointed, that it takes this many episodes to get to the real deal."
16 April 2021,WandaVision,9.0,I'm a huge fan of magic and magic systems in fiction and so it's no wonder that some of my favorite characters are Dr Strange and the Scarlet Witch. It's important to go into this show blind because the surreal presentation and the slow unfurling of the plot is gripping.
25 January 2021,"Definitely a cash-cow for Disney, sigh....",7.0,"**Update** OK ok, I'll agree with others rating the entire 1st Season as I went back and finished watching the final episodes. Definitely builds up and gets more Avenger/Marvel-like. Hopefully Season 2 doesn't drag us thru early episodes just to keep milking the series...

Disney held off on releasing this to tease us with Mandalorian/etc and now trying to keep us hooked suffering through this until Falcon or Winter Soldier saves the day??

These first few episodes have been completely useless to a plot we suspect will explain what is going on in the mind of Wanda & Vision. I gave it a 2 only because the two main characters are the same actors from the movies. I will try to be patient and hopefully slowly follow the remaining episodes and will update my review as necessary.

Sadly, all those that criticize watchers reviewing (although negatively) the initial episodes are being brain-washed to believe we have to wait until the end of a show's season to critique?? Shame on you; stop wishing/waiting for better results and hold Disney accountable for the current product."
22 May 2021,Not disappointed at all,8.0,Slow story but episode by episode it increases our excitement.
10 March 2021,Extremely watchable and craftily clever,10.0,"No spoilers here, just admiration for the writers and actors alike. Seemlessly following on from the films this picks up the Marvel baton and takes the viewer on a clever journey that Moulder and Skully would be proud to investigate! Twists and turns without the viewer really understanding, until further in, why they've been taken along the route make for captivating television. Wanda and Vision are expertly portrayed meaning that the viewer is absorbed into the story in a way that leaves you with admiration and desperately needing more! Great mini series and highly recommended viewing."
30 January 2021,Why the low reviews?,10.0,I don't get how people are not liking this? So many low reviews are from the first two episodes. Each joke has a double meaning and it has me waiting impatiently until next Friday. Unique and creative and unlike anything I've seen from Marvel in the past. Takes some great characters and has you wondering wth is going on. I just wish the episodes were longer :/
16 January 2021,Weird,2.0,Just strange - very strange - like a bad joke. Just so weird and hard to know what the heck they were hoping to achieve. We tuned out half was through was that bad. We tried episode 2 equally strange. Pass.
30 May 2021,Genius,7.0,"Genius creativity to say the least. Two reasons for not rating this higher: 1) Because the storyline is so out of the park, it would have been good to have a few more ""hints"" in the early episode to help the viewer endure. 2) Heroes once again show no effort at reconciling with those they have wronged.

Like so many other MCU shows, this series leaves you with a desire to see more, thus providing you with a hope that the beloved characters will once again return."
13 February 2021,I could give it a 10/10 based on creativity alone,10.0,So including everything else gives it a 20. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are amazing actors.
29 March 2021,Surprisingly Good,8.0,"I thought this was gonna be boring at first, but turns out it was great experience watching this show. The way the stories going from start to the end really exciting."
10 October 2021,Best limited superhero series,10.0,
31 January 2021,I will give it an 8 after 2 episodes and a 9 after 5,9.0,"Just because Wanda is gorgeous as a 50//60s sitcom wife. Up to episode 5...gets better and better, a very interesting idea. And lemme say its kinda fun to read the reviews people wrote after eps 1 and 2, thinking that was all the show was...Have people that reviewed it after 2 episodes edited there reviews now?"
15 January 2021,"Weird, boring and stupid",2.0,"My main question, are these 10's score reviews for real? This is a strange plot, but people call ""new"". Not to say that Wanda has completely change her acccent. Btw. Chapters really last 20 minutes, and there are almost 10 minutes for credits."
11 March 2021,A great show!.... if you're a kid. Sadly I'm not.,4.0,The title says it all. Barely An hour worth of story spread across nine episodes. Too much hype and too much disappointment.
12 February 2021,I Enthusiastically Turn Back to MCU,9.0,
28 March 2021,Strange yet engaging,10.0,
11 May 2021,Is it a marvel or not?,9.0,An original tv show from marvel. Wandavision look like its not a marvel during 2-3 episode. It was very surprising at first and after it become a classic marvel like we all know. But for the beginning it was pretty clever to do this. I really appreciate marvel to try something new and they did it very well. Congratulations!. Really enjoy it and put a high score just for the risk they took with wandavision.
5 March 2021,Great,8.0,
17 January 2021,Boring,3.0,Wanda and vision in a 50s sitcom full of 50s sitcom tropes. If you're old enough to feel nostalgic about 50s sitcoms and also like Marvel you might really enjoy this but my guess is that's a pretty small demographic so I'm not sure who this show is targeted at...
24 January 2021,This is why we can't have nice things,9.0,"This is extremely well written by an obvious subject matter expert of not only Marvel but also classic television.

Altogether it's awesome. Watch with zero expectations. Enjoy the ride.

I think Disney's main issue was releasing two instead of the first three episodes at once. Otherwise, it's just great entertainment."
4 April 2021,Awful show,1.0,"This show is an embarrassment for MCU. It starts off terrible and never gets better. These writers should be fired. Not sure how anyone likes this show. I totally regret watching all of the episodes. Anyone who gives this show anything above a 5 is a total fanboy and not being objective. I love MCU, but this is pathetic. Be honest, it's awful."
5 October 2021,U WILL NEVER GET BORED,10.0,I have seen all the marvel series and I'd say WandaVision is the best one after Loki it will entertain u from ep 1 to ep 9 at the starting in the first 2 episode i was confused of what the show actually was but later onwards from ep 3 everything starts making sense there are various number of twists and turns and never watch doctor strange multiverse of madness without watching wandavision because it has a lot of connection with doctor strange and before watching it u have to watch some marvel movies like captain marvel and ant man and thor etc. And it's much better than falcon and the winter soldier.
15 January 2021,At least it's something different,5.0,"""Marvel bravely started off phase 4 with a new concept."" However, I don't see the hype behind Marvel trying something new. There are many other studios, filmmakers and directors who have gone against the norm and at the same time have produced a good piece of entertainment. WandaVision is a concept the MCU needed from the beginning. Only having originality now, after 20 or so films, doesn't make it a great series.

On the other hand one thing I did actually enjoy was the character development of Wanda and Vision. If you look at any other Marvel film that featured Wanda and Vision they were bland characters with absolutely nothing going on, now they are discovered characters and starting to become three dimensional to the audience."
9 March 2021,WandaVision is best,8.0,First 2 episode are slow but after that I enjoyed the show very much by creating my theory about what will happen next. A great show. Marvel never disappoint me
16 January 2021,Give it time!!,9.0,"I totally don't understand the awful reviews, we're only 2 episodes in!!

The opening 2 episodes YES are a bit weird, and YES are totally different to anything we've seen in the MCU.

But we have 7 episodes to go, and have you not seen the trailers...its obviously going to get soooooo good!!

Give it time before you start with the negatives 😊"
8 December 2021,Amazing! Can't wait to see more of scarlet witch.,10.0,"A journey of misery and loss and the birth of a hero. A true story for a character known as wanda, gripped from start to finish. And the ending wow a true masterpiece. This needs to be the only season for her she doesn't need anymore. I'm really looking forward to her next chapter in. Doctor strange and the multiverse."
13 February 2021,Not a 50's sitcom,10.0,
7 February 2021,"Finally! Original, creativity in a world of remakes and reboots!",10.0,"I love this show and it's originality. I am not surprised at the negative reviews as majority of people are used to bland, regurgitated formulaic content. Keep it up writers!!!"
17 January 2021,Great characters reduced to pure pulp,1.0,"I dont mind black and white tv, but i figured at some point it change to another universe or just back to normal. This never happend for 2 episodes long. Nothing seemed to be serious and the humor is shockingly bad. Also the laughing in the background due to this being a sitcom of some kind was really annoying. I couldnt make it through the second episode and the 1st was a total bore.

I dont care that this could be a setup to something else, they should have caught on to that from the start. I am so done pretensions show that build up for ever and give a climax at the very end all the while wasting my time.

The black and white parts should at least have been switched back and forth with this supposed other reality. Anyway i am done."
30 March 2021,Great Theme .....,9.0,Wanda back all things that lost from her life .... For that she is creating a multiverse and bring back Vision .... Especially the acting of Wanda is Nice.
2 February 2021,Marvel is Back!,10.0,"If you're a marvel fan, you're going to love it. Sit tight!"
6 March 2021,8.2/10.,8.0,
21 June 2021,Marvel played with my emotions.,9.0,"This show made me cry. It kept me at the edge of my seat, and it did not disappoint. Phenomenal. I loved it and Elizabeth Olsen gave the performance of her life. Her acting made me feel as if I was there, grieving with Wanda. 9/10."
23 April 2021,Terrible,1.0,"The usual garbage childish adults love so much. If you love Marvel movies, by all means, watch this, you'll like it for sure."
21 January 2021,Worst Marvel based series yet,2.0,"This is one of the worst series I have ever watched. Just because it carries the Marvel label doesn't mean it's going to be good. Most if the sitcoms it has emulated to date were horrible as well. Perhaps it will get better, but I doubt it."
15 January 2021,Unwatchable,1.0,"An intriguing premise and conception totally ruined by the laugh track. Maybe there was a time when audiences were prompted to find dialogue and situations funny by including a laugh track. I know it's supposed to imitate a '50s show, but please enough with the moronic laughing at every sentence uttered by every cast member!"
17 January 2021,Good so far,8.0,"Only 2 episodes in, but have enjoyed the mix of send up of 50's and 60's sitcoms plus the underlying mystery of what's really going on. At times it could do with a few more geuine gags instead of just send ups. However, there is also an enjoyable homage element to it all too. I grew up in the 60's and enjoyed those old shows, but it's also worth remembering how bad they were in many respects. Wanda Vision balances out the homage/send up elements fairly well. Will be interesting to see how they handle future decades and also what the truth really is. Shame a few people are not appreciating the craft behind this."
26 February 2021,SLOW STARTERS,10.0,
25 March 2021,Don't get fooled by the odd apperance of First Two Episodes!,7.0,"At first, what appeared as a tribute for classic American Sitcoms; eventually elaborated into an in-depth character study. Taking a look at the bigger picture; it is safe to say, ""WandaVision"" could be addressed as the fanciest project endeavored by Marvel to date.

Amidst the mounting acceptance of OTT platforms, Giant names in the industry are progressively shifting their focus to this lucrative space. Following the completion of Avengers and Phase III of MCU, Disney & Marvel were seeking out opportunities to keep on expanding their Portfolio. At long last, they decided to go with Spin-offs. 'WandaVision' being the first in line.

Before I proceed, allow me to emphasize the fact that it would be wiser to exercise patience during the first two episodes. They may seem awfully wrong and unsuited to some; But please be assured, they do have a solid reason to exist in the first place!

Bearing in mind its rather fascinating coalition of Humor, Sentiment & Action; there has been no shortage of entertainment for the viewers. Albeit the general outcome is quite fulfilling but that doesn't advocate faultlessness. On the contrary; the Screenplay suffers from indirectness. Mainly betwixt transitioning phases!

Barring a handful of negatives, this one does stand out in additional aspects.

For instance, the Characters are well fleshed out. Especially in view of both Wanda & Vision. We become acquainted with their strong ties. Besides the joyous tidbits, the story did possess a relatively darker tone towards the end.

Digging deeper into Wanda's tragic past; illustrating the miserable journey she had withstood thus far. Setting forth a pitiful side of her personality that we had not previously been aware of!

Lastly, the performances have been pretty darn good. Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Paul Bettany as Vision; both doing an amazing job respectively. An Honorable mention goes to Kathryn Hahn for her unerring act as Agnes/Agatha! She was simply excellent.

We also got some known faces reprising their roles from Marvel's previous outings! However, I gotta admit they apparently lacked an appropriate amount of exposure! Therefore failing to assert their dominance!

In a nutshell, This has been an avant-garde experience that seriously caught me off guard! If you are an ardent fan of Marvel, then this is undoubtedly a must-watch. For others; just go with limited expectations, and rest assured you will have a nice time."
18 January 2021,8.2? I don't know Rick.,1.0,"Just watch the profiles of ""people"" giving 10 or 9, a lot of them only have 1 review, guess what is it, wandavision!!! And a lot of them are indian profiles. It's Marvel inflating the rating, how low. One third of the first episode are for credits only!!!! Is it supposed to make me laugh? So you need 4 whole episodes to be impressed? The boyz make that whitin the first 5 minutes."
16 January 2021,Enjoying the different approach!,9.0,"Having a hard time reading all of the negative reviews without shaking my head. First of all only two episodes have aired, the classic sitcom style was done on purpose, and this show has pulled more Easter eggs from the comics than any film in the MCU. If you don't understand what is going on, then google, or read some comics e.g. ""House of M"" and ""Vision"" from 2015, or ""Vision and the Scarlet Witch"" instead of trashing the show and it's direction."
30 January 2021,Never in my life!,10.0,"Has a show captivated me so much, like this show has. It's a mastercraft in storytelling and television and is just mesmerizing. Every episode has blown me away and desperite to watch the next episode...which I can't, because I've got to wait another week!"
6 March 2021,I redact my earlier ratings.,5.0,"Woow. It's so so horrible.

9 episodes with a woman dealing with her guilt, and despair!?

Are there only women writers left?"
29 January 2021,Excellent!!!!!,9.0,It is one of the best superhero series. Has the perfect combination of suspense and comedy
5 March 2021,Nice creative addition to the Marvel universe,7.0,
27 March 2021,Don't give up,10.0,"If you gave up after two episodes you missed an awesome series complementing the Marvel Universe. It does start off with a ""what the hell am I watching"" but after episode 2 it gets so good. Even though I really enjoyed episode 2, very funny. As usual it ends up giving you a teaser of more to come. Love Marvel."
17 January 2021,Really?,3.0,This is terrible and feels like a dramatic dumbing Dow of the MCU. Why would they even think a 50s themed super hero show would appeal to then target audience?
19 March 2021,A must watch for any Marvel fan.,8.0,"What a way for the MCU to return! Marvel have clearly set their sights on the weird and wonderful post-Phase 3 and what a way to start! Wandavision is by far the most out there MCU project to date. As I'm sure many reviews cover, it is a slow burner initially but a worthwhile watch for anyone who's invested in the previous 23 films for the plot points, easter eggs, and character developments alone. Sadly, as the final episodes approach I'm sure you'll get the feeling 'how will they resolve all this with only a few episodes left' and, whilst most of the threads tie up nicely, you'd be right as much of the ending feels quite rushed and inconclusive.

The visuals are great and the quality of the series feels a lot closer to the films when compared to the previous Marvel Netflix shows, although the CGI is slightly over-ambitions at times.

I'm not sure how well the series would translate to your oblivious viewer who may have stumbled across the show on the 'What's New' section of Disney+, however, as primarily the plot is drip fed to the viewer, ultimately creating more questions than it answers; setting up future installations on the big and small screen I'm sure. The series is also heavily reliant on at least a fundamental understanding of the key events of the MCU timeline, especially for many of the emotional moments to land... an unfair criticism possibly, but a warning at least.

I'd definitely recommend to any Marvel/ comic book fan although I'd watch a refresher on YouTube before diving in. Enjoy."
19 March 2021,Best in the middle,7.0,
3 April 2021,No soul after Endgame,1.0,"So we watched all episodes and sadly it was boring without plot, and we will not watch these again. My son did not enjoy watching these too. The mediocrity of this show is on par with Falcon and Winter Soldier. We will go back to watching other Marvel movies from time to time. Let's see how the Loki show measures to our expectations."
16 January 2021,No rating so far,,"We're only two episodes in so a rating strikes me as foolish.

I did find the first two episodes scattered as the writing tries very hard to be many things and doesn't really succeed at any of them. In episode 2 we start to get a stronger sense that none of this is real and it is all in Wanda's mind and it could be interesting to find out what is happening and if this supposition is true. I have my own theories and I won't spoil things for readers by including them.

That's going to take some tighter editing in the coming episodes

It is sad that while the runtime is 36 minutes 9 of those minutes are credits that very few will watch once they figure out there is no magic post credits scene"
16 January 2021,Don't listen to all the negative reviews,10.0,"Everyone is watching the first episodes and letting that dictate their entire outlook on the show. The first two episodes are very quirky and weird. THEY'RE MEANT TO BE. It's supposed to make you feel kinda uncomfortable, to go with the entire undertone that's also meant to be unsettling. It's a good show so far! They're just setting it up! And I, for one, am excited about where this show is heading. Give it a shot!"
24 July 2021,What is a grief?,10.0,"WandaVision is proof that a superhero series can be a very high standard: intrigues, amuses and touch.

A must for any MCU fan!"
6 March 2021,Imaginative and outstanding.,10.0,Marvel studios deliver again. Refrained from reviewing until finishing the series and so glad I did. The first few episodes are confusing until put into context by a well explained plot that continues to unfold over the series. It has a unique feel that continues deliver a storyline that does not disappoint. A fantastic watch. In short an outstanding stand alone series that gives the audience exactly what they didn't know they needed.
6 April 2021,What..,1.0,"..the hell is this lol I mean,couldn't they have found a better ""actress"" than ""Lizzie""????

Unbearable.....hers ""acting"" is completely ruining interesting series that this could have been with a real actress."
28 February 2021,EXCELLENT SHOW,9.0,A must see for marvel fans. Second to end games just the best.
31 January 2021,Exceptional show,10.0,"This is such a clever and smart show, full of Easter eggs for Marvel fans. I absolutely adore the wittiness and quirkiness. Please embrace something different! If you think this show is dull you have not been watching properly. The acting is superb too. Well done, Marvel!"
19 February 2021,Shut up the haters,9.0,I trust in the power of this film at the very first time. The rating is going up and I'm happy for that
8 March 2021,"Creative first, Typical marvel later",8.0,It's weird to see many reviews saying the start is slow and weaker than the rest of the show. The first episodes are actually the ones that make this show unique in the MARVEL franchise. The rest is very Marvel. We have all seen it in many many movies before. Not saying that its bad. The quality of the show is really good but once the show turned all typical Marvel it became just old Marvel. TV shows really help character development for characters that have not (yet) had their big standalone movies. I was shockingly surprised by the performance of Lizzie. She was simply amazing. Just a notch better than everyone else who also did a really a good job. If you just want the same Marvel formula over and over again and just enjoy that part than just keep watching to the end. You will be treated well. If you are like me and love to see more creativity in the MCU franchise than the first episodes are the ones to watch out for! Unfortunately 10/10 is out of the question. Compared to some other shows it lacked depth but no doubt it was a fun ride with lots and lots of lovely detail and easter eggs for those who are really into the Marvel comics and not just here for the entertainment.
20 March 2021,Why all the hate?,9.0,I'm currently on episode 4 and have absolutely no idea what I'm watching but I like it! It's definitely different from everything Marvel has made before but it is definitely a fun watch
16 January 2021,Awful. Terrible. A complete waste of time.,7.0,"This is a REALLY bad remake of Bewitched and I Love Lucy. That type of comedy with a laugh track just does not work in modern television.

I have only watched the first two episodes - that is all that has been released so far. Perhaps thing will change after newer episodes are released, but I have a strict ""three strikes"", rule, and Wanda Vision already has two strikes..."
28 December 2021,"WYLION - Wanda Wanda Vision, W WandaVision",7.0,"This was very interested. Started off very slow, was a bit confused as to where it was going to go. Somehow kept me hooked with the old school sitcom esk episodes. Nice to see Scarlett Witch and Vision together as they have good chemistry. Like I said it was interesting, definitely some good scenes such as when the main characters argue and have a brief stand off towards the end of the show. Definitely worth the watch. I'd come back to watch a few episodes, others were disposable. Although it was just an average show, it was different and I like that."
18 January 2021,Meh it's just a sitcom which is cheesy,4.0,If your expecting something superhuman genre you should just save time and skip this.
13 March 2021,Best series marvel could ever produced,10.0,"All characters in this series are brilliant and this is the best thing marvel could do after endgame. Trust me this show deserves all emmy awards, go watch it now if you haven't seen it may be because u are living under a rock, lol"
5 March 2021,GOOD TO SEE WITH FAMILY AROUND,9.0,Nothing special in season 1 but i hope marvel is going in a good direction
21 January 2021,the definition of cringe,1.0,"Don't get me wrong. You can be a normal human being and understand what is happening in this show, where the writers are coming from and where the show is going, but still hate its guts. What were they thinking? 2 episodes of what can only be described as a war crime, leading maybe at some point to something decent? Why would you make me suffer this much with the promise that the show will become normal eventually, except that it never does? This is pure pain. I cannot remember being so disgusted by something on tv ever."
29 October 2022,Best best series after endgame,9.0,I don't know what to say about this series this is an amazing series this is like one of the best series I have ever watched in my entire life the plot was very unpredictable I was not able to predict anything at all I had no idea or what was going to happen in future and that made it very thrilling and the characters are amazing the back story of wanda is amazing like how they told her story that was really amazing I love the villain she was amazing she was very evil and overall she didn't lack any characters of being a villain. Wanda is a great hero and the way she control her emotions was really amazing.
30 July 2021,Keep watching!,10.0,I legit ugly cried at the end. Such a genius way of storytelling this show was beyond amazing!
16 January 2021,Great Setup So Far,10.0,"Great setup so far. The show is charming, funny and light (or so they want you to think) within the constraints of a PG show, which is very difficult. There are hints here and there that there's more than meets the eye, and that their perfect little world is in the midst of crumbling. I expect it will get more tense and interesting as the season goes on."
25 February 2021,Utter bilge,1.0,"I can't believe that they actually gave this rubbish the green light. It's tired before the credits start at the beginning.

I'd rather watch reruns of My Favourite Martian than garbage.

Utterly dire."
2 March 2021,Unexpected 10/10,10.0,The real series starts from episode 3 a must watch series for every marvel fan 👌 10/10 looking forward for the finale
16 December 2021,Roshane Campbell,10.0,
1 March 2021,EXCELLENT!!,10.0,"Honestly,Episode 1-3 was slow but I understand the show for being slow,it's building something. When I watched episode 4 until now,Episode 8,wow! Elizabeth Olsen was phenomenal so is the rest of the cast. One of the best TV Shows I've ever watched."
4 June 2021,Great mystery. Ending dissapointing.,7.0,
10 April 2021,"But what is grief, if not love persevering?",8.0,"WandaVision is a love letter to situational comedies, while also passing of as a mystery series. The show personally shines when it blends the sitcom angle with the mystery, and personally doesn't work with the consent changing out of the sitcom setting with a motley crew of agents. It is a greatly crafted series when it chooses to be a sitcom, not a mystery. It was nice seeing recreations of situational comedies formats and being able to see them evolve. I was hoping this would be a return to form for sitcoms, however I was left with a cute charming series about Wanda and Vision's relationship. Elizbeth Olsen and Paul Bettany performances truly capture the magic of the era, and is worth watching for that alone. Regardless of what I say. Go have a watch. It's an experience best without spoilers."
28 June 2022,Wanda is a wizard,8.0,"I enjoyed this series. The non linear depiction where the mystery is solved only later, this felt more a thriller than mere drama. The actors carried their characters very well and I must applaud Olsen for her seamless portrayal of Wanda in misery and might."
12 March 2021,Nicely done!,8.0,"I've never watched a Marvel TV series ever, but with Wanda and Vision I had to give it a shot. Great story, fantastic performances by all the cast. I think the first three episodes could have been merged into one, as you can actually grasp what's going on in the first 10-15 mins, the other 2.5 episodes feel like fillers, but those are good quality fillers, so not impossible to watch anyways. Very good Marvel, you kept it going."
20 September 2021,Absolutely brilliant,10.0,By far the best Marvel show out there. Very clever storyline - fantastic special Fx - pure genius. Well done Marvel. Simply amazing.
16 January 2021,Check out,10.0,Custodianship have to go back and eat and it will eat the food so please call me whenever you get home and love it please call please please call me please please call me call me please please call
6 March 2021,What is love?,8.0,
20 March 2021,SPECTACULAR,10.0,"Marvel did it again! It was an unusual Marvel project. It was everything I need after the Endgame. I love Wanda and I witnessed her struggle, pain and growth. Ignore all negative comments about first episodes. Not every Marvel project must meet our expectations. Thank you Marvel for this amazing show!"
31 March 2021,One of the best instalments of the MCU,10.0,"Wandavision is one of the most creative, captivating and well done shows I've seen in a long time. And finally Marvel is placing strong female superheroes in their own shows and woman villains too. Sad that it's taken all the way to Phase 3-4 of the MCU to give the women superheroes their own light instead of being the sidekicks they were for the past 10 years.

Wandas character development is easily one of the best in the entire franchise and this show helps that blossom. Elizabeth Olsen is amazing in this show and nails every era of sitcom as well as every pain, laugh and heart that her character goes through.

I've watched this show twice already and it's satisfying to have a new Marvel instalment that's more to it then action. The depth to the characters and mix of comedy, heart, wonder and power is something to be hold.

Love this show and can't sing it and it's praises enough."
28 March 2021,It's the WandaVision show starring Wanda and vision,6.0,
8 March 2021,Well worth a watch if you can pass the first 2.5 episodes!,8.0,"Exactly as the title says: get through the first 2.5 episodes and you're in it to win it! Not your regular intro for a marvel show or any show for that matter and yes, it begins to make sense after the very annoying intro and yes."
3 April 2021,Very beautiful,8.0,
8 July 2021,Brilliant show until the finale.,7.0,"Up until the finale it was an odd but truly fantastic show with acting master classes from both Bettany and Olsen, suddenly both characters got a chance to shine and show what the MCU had been missing by making them bit part characters, the mystery of what was going on was compelling, side characters interesting and seemed to get better with each passing episodes.

But then came the finale, oh dear the finale. It was one big CGI loud mess, full of eye rolling ridiculous moments and some really bad make up. Where everything else in the series had seemed so carefully planned out this felt rushed and unfinished. And for me personally ruining everything that came before it."
10 July 2022,This is not Just A Superhero Story,7.0,"Aside from being a superhero in Marvel Universe, as we all know the weight comes with it, there is a deep notion in the story told here - loneliness. A simple feel of being alone that progress overtime to be something we could never recognize afterwards. The theme in in which this notion is introduced is very novice and creative but not really outstanding. Of course, Marvel quality of directions and effects is out of questioning. A big Salute to Bettany as Vision for his outstanding performance, then Olsen as Wanda, and kids then rest of cast. I appreciate projects that reflect our lives and forces us to second look what we maybe missing out. Therefore, I enjoy watching this one as I enjoy thinking about how lonely we or our closed ones might be."
18 July 2021,Another same stuff from MCU,6.0,"I have to admit that this series disappointed me a bit. I don't even have that much of a problem with the introductory episodes because they tried something different, something original and that isn't a copy paste of most MCU movies. In the end, however, the series turned into just that. They introduced some characters into the series completely unnecessarily, they have no purpose. Let's say the series is made so that we don't even need a main antagonist, but when they introduced it towards the end, it seemed to me irrelevant. Some parts seemed stretched to me so I got the impression that the whole plot could fit into one average MCU movie. They asked some questions to which they did not give us answers so they ask us to continue to follow and watch the rest of the story. I give the biggest minus to the series because it turns out to be completely irrelevant."
10 March 2021,Cmon man...,5.0,"The best part of the entire show is when vision eats the gum and it gets stuck in his gears. Whoever thought of this idea is a genius. Sadly, the rest of the show was pretty boring-especially when agents of shield showed up. Please just leave. There was a way to make this concept smart and thought provoking but the show runners decided to treat the audience like babies instead. Figures."
16 January 2021,it's a shtick,1.0,"It should have remained an idea, dumb, dumb, dumb, my review is too short, but I only wanted to say how really dumb this show is, a show based on a concept that was best left in the mind of its writer, oh, ha, ha, ha... it's supposed to be funny, not, it's supposed to be cute, not, ho hum, ho hum, have I written enough?"
15 January 2021,What a great series!!!,9.0,After just 2 episodes I'm hooked. I love these 2 character's and yes I gave it a 10 and you know why? Cause I can. After the series finale my score went to a 9/10. Definitely worth a look!!
7 March 2021,"Good start, fun mystery, underwhelming ending",8.0,
15 January 2021,A lot of fun but won't be for everyone.,9.0,"Growing up on old fashioned sitcoms like the Munsters and the Dick Van Dyke Show, I really enjoyed the first two episodes and I like that there's a sort of intrigue and unsettlement going on. I don't really like when a show spills it's proverbial beans early on, so being confused at this point is fine by me. I have a niggling feeling that the casual audience aren't going to enjoy it very much and honestly, I get it; it's unlike anything Marvel or pretty much anyone else has done recently and it's clear that it's going to take it's sweet time to get to the juice, which is fine by me but a fair warning to be issued for anyone who is expecting a fast paced blockbuster. I'm gonna give it a 9 for now, subject to change through the advancing weeks. Thank you for reading my brief and rambling review and have a lovely day or night wherever you are."
6 February 2021,It's Certianly Something,9.0,I'm not sure what it is or what exactly is going on but its entertaining and im loving it so far.
5 March 2021,Don't judge the series on your baseless theories!,10.0,Watching wanda vision for the whole month waiting for each and every episode felt like a year to me. Reading the theories and here we came to an end. As for the character Wanda this series was so important for everyone to know for her past and as well as for her future. This series was way good and I would recommend you all to watch it. Can't describe this series much because I am overwhelmed after watching a superhero series after a while!
16 March 2021,A VISIONary show ;),10.0,
31 January 2021,a great hit of marvel,8.0,"8/10

is series with episodes misterious and investigation for discovery what's happening."
21 February 2021,Love it!!,9.0,"Falling more and more in love with this show by the episode. Finally, a truely creative, original, funny, entertaining show which sotryline is much more than what it seems to be. It is so well worked on even to the smallest detail. Amazing work by Marvel after Endgame."
16 February 2021,Unique,10.0,"WandaVision is one of the best things to come out of Marvel Studios by far. The characters are all so captivating and the plot keeps you hooked at every moment. It's truly a unique experience (especially considering some Marvel films feel like rehashes of previous Marvel films).

Also, Wanda finally gets her moment to actually shine and so does the actress who plays her Elizabeth Olsen. Paul Bettany as Vision is also a treat."
6 March 2021,Amazing!,9.0,"This show is amazing. The beginning is absolutely wonderful. I love old sitcoms, and this was a perfect homage to them, with small bits and pieces of hints and clues to make you say ""what""! Elizabeth Olsen is absolutely phenomenal and THE BEST OLSEN! (Seriously she makes her sister look like garbage, which they are) Paul Bettany is fantastic, and Wanda and Vision are 2 of my favorite Avengers! The ending is just the icing on the cake for this out of the box show! Marvel keeps proving why they're the best!"
5 March 2021,Terrible!,2.0,"This series is terrible, but nobody will admit it, they just geek out over nothing. Well I will, it took eight dull episodes to depict a story that could have been completed in 2 episodes. Don't get me wrong the actors and acting is decent but the writing and total lack of interesting development is exhausting. Everybody knew the whole storyline from the first episode, an environment created out of denial. This series couldn't have seemed any longer, in fact, it was vey difficult to even make it through each episode. To be honest, MANY episodes I didn't even make it half way."
26 February 2021,First few episodes very boring,5.0,"First 3-4 episodes are very boring and you can even skip them, I dont think you will miss anything. Later it gets more interesting story. After finishing whole series I give this 5 because of very slow boring 3-4 episodes."
17 January 2021,"it's a parody AND a mystery: it's two, two, two shows in one!",8.0,
31 July 2021,It's for pretentious saps,1.0,

5 March 2021,Epic Emotional Rollercoaster,10.0,
18 March 2021,A missed opportunity,4.0,
17 January 2021,"Poor structure...dull, uneven and unintelligent",,"As this mess unfolds, you can applaud the initiative but have to be stunned at the execution. It's flat out awful. For Marvel's 1st Disney plus effort this is stunningly bad. It meanders aimlessly leaving only Easter eggs as entertainment. 75% of what hits the screen is innocuous and flat out ridiculous. I understand the concept of irony but this isn't even bad parody. It's writers that think they are smart but are not. It's bad episodic TV that doesn't understand the format.

Here's hoping Marvel learns from this misfire."
13 April 2021,Easily my favorite sci-fi ever!,10.0,
20 February 2021,Avg..show,7.0,If this same show does not have marvel's name inculde with it than may be not 8.2 this show gets 6 or 6.5 rating...
26 February 2021,More Overhyped Marvel,1.0,"I wish people would stop overhyping everything that comes out of Marvel. This show was interesting, but it quickly falls apart. The high quality days of Marvel are quickly coming to an end."
6 August 2021,"Among the best, most creative ideas ever conceived - but plays it safe and superhero-y",6.0,"So I'll start by saying I'm not a fan of the MCU: truth be told I had watched ""The Incredible Hulk"" way back when, and recently tried watching ""Daredevil"" but hated the pilot episode with a passion - perhaps coming from ""Gomorra: La serie"" I just wasn't ready to see mafiosi kung-fu fighting; but these two are the only things, best I recall. When I heard about ""WandaVision"" I was intrigued, however. I fell in love with the idea of a ""mainline"" Marvel series playing with the format of a series, by having the characters literally live inside one. You could just foresee a great experience: a 1950s-style black-and-white sitcom with a story dealing with these sci-fi characters, one of whom is the Scarlet Witch. If you're at least vaguely familiar with the plot of the MCU (as I happen to be, and as you have to be to get some parts of the show) and/or with Marvel comics (at least vaguely), then you probably already have a good hunch what the story will be: ""No more mutants"" and all that. However, you might also suspect a twist coming. I won't spoil the plot - I typically care little for spoilers, but this one I watched ""blind"" and it was intense - but when it comes to the premise let's just say that they stick the landing reasonably well, it all checks out, the worst is avoided.

By now I've read some other reviews and am utterly perplexed by some people's positions. In my opinion, the first couple of episodes fly by too quickly rather than too slowly, as some object. The series had potential for several legitimately great seasons in that mould, the initial idea being just too good to waste on about an hour of content. Unfortunately they start hurrying things along a bit too much, and the quality dips, then suddenly peaks in ""All-New Halloween Spooktacular!"", drops to a new low, recovers in the acting-heavy ""Previously On"", and concludes in a horrendous, absolutely unforgivable ""The Series Finale"".

""WandaVision"" changes decorations rapidly. Each episode - a new decade, not to mention the parallel plot happening outside the series within the series. I wonder whether some people better versed in American sitcoms' history have produced any kind of analysis, going episode by episode over the inspirations for each one, the stylistic changes. I'd love to read or watch such an analysis, I think some of things revealed there could be quite profound. Even the acting notably changes to fit the style of each new decade, with amazing subtlety! The acting (especially by the leads, but also by Agnes and Norm) is brilliant in general. As the series juggles many hats, on many occasions you see these actors put before a challenge: switch from comedic to dramatic mode within the same scene, maybe mid-sentence - and they pull it off! The show is juicy with material for the actors to act their their hearts out, so if you happen to love these ones mentioned - well isn't that just red meat for you!

So why didn't I rate the show as highly as I honestly hoped to, having watched the first episodes? Let's just say that the dramatic potential of the show was touched upon, but then the writing team must've gotten distracted by a squirrel running outside, and MCU's main storywriters' squad walked into the abandoned office equally absent-mindedly, looked at the script and went: ""Hold on, is that even a superhero show? How can you tell? Should we have 2-4 villains in there? Like, the main character might or might not be a villain herself in the plot, sure, but is somebody going to be punched through a building or not? And we won't take ""not"" for an answer!"" And there you had it. Now, I'm a compromise-seeking sort of person in general, but none of the villains _had_ to do any such things. Peaceful conflict resolution was disappointingly absent.

Oh, and also the humour sometimes fell a bit flat, felt gimmicky or forced, there were technical issues here and there (absent continuity and such) and there was this character called Darcy, who was annoying, smug, quipped unfunny nonsense with every breath (of which she had too many) and was unfailingly involved in some of the worst scenes (to be fair, she _made_ a lot of them so bad, but not all). She's an astrophysicist by trade, but at one point magically becomes a hacker. Smart people's jobs are all the same, is that the idea?.. Also, I had some issues with some moral and logical implications of the finale, but the less I think about this episode, the better my opinion of ""WandaVision"" stays."
15 January 2021,bad start but has potential,1.0,
15 January 2021,Most boring show I have ever seen,1.0,Probably one of the most boring episodes of a show I have seen in my life. They took the 50s tv show stuff too far and too long.
22 September 2021,The (disappointing) Wandavision experience.,7.0,
15 January 2021,Do people not realize it's supposed to be like old sitcom tropes,8.0,I really enjoyed it I see alot of bad reviews talking about how bad it was and how much it was like I love lucy and bewitched and had laugh track(that did get annoying at times) but that's the point.
24 January 2021,Not What I Expected. Not Interested,2.0,"Wandavision is a sitcom, more precisely a parity of 1950's type shows. It's obvious there is a reason for the charade of super heroes acting like the Cleavers in ""Leave it to Beaver"" but I frankly don't care: I hate old time sitcoms, even if it is a parity.

Seriously, someone is overthinking this stuff and getting too cute by half.

I suppose there is an audience for this type of show, but WandaVision did not interest me at all, and I am not wasting any more time on it."
2 April 2021,I was apprehensive that this would win me over,8.0,"As an MCU enthusiast, I didn't expect to like this series a lot. My expectations were Ant-Man levels. By that I mean, Ant-Man movies have been alright, but not even remotely close to Iron Man or Captain America levels.

The callbacks to old television programs, that were shown in trailers, caught my interest, but I wasn't sold yet.

As the series continued, the character development picked up speed, and the story became more enthralling.

By the end of the series, I was sold that this was an absolute success. It turned in to a roller coaster ride, storyline wise, and was a lot of fun.

Elizabeth Olsen is extremely attractive, and that was an original drawing point for myself... but this series delivered at a level that more than exceeded my expectations."
17 January 2021,Boring,2.0,Stupid...2 episodes enough..not funny.. not entertaining..not anything..just a struggle to watch .i dont care how good a show is if it cant grasp you in fiirst episode i give up
8 January 2022,Wow! What a show,10.0,I wish there were plans for further seasons. The story is brilliant and executed immaculately. Interesting and magical all at once. Anyone with a love of the arts and film would appreciate this show. Not to mention the stellar acting of every character.
6 March 2021,"First three episodes 10 stars, eps 5 & 6 9 stars and ep 4, 7, 8 & 9 8 stars",8.0,
14 August 2021,Decent ideas getting wasted,5.0,"I liked the concept, special effects, and production design, but pretty much lost interest after the first bunch of episodes. Of course nobody was expecting deep insights into the characters' minds or visionary filmmaking, but more risks could have taken. The show didn't need a villain at all costs neither a bunch of useless characters that are just there to draw connections to spin-offs or other Marvel products."
13 April 2021,my opinion,10.0,
2 April 2021,It was good,8.0,"I enjoyed wandavision. Elizabeth Olsen is hot anyway so it's always a plus.

It was different granted but overall I thought it was good.

My main gripe though is..you are telling me Wanda did all this to innocent people and literally no other avenger goes to visit to say look Wanda calm it down love. This is the problem with the individual avenger stories. I don't get it. What..so the rest hear about it whilst eating breakfast and think meh I'm sure she will sort it ougy."
15 January 2021,Slow and annoying,4.0,
7 March 2021,Starting solid but dropped everything special in the finale,7.0,Wanda was brilliant for its use of intrigue and Marvel really thought through how they wanted to pull that off. Until the last episode. It was bipolar how different the ending was when you look at what the show began as it dropped all progression to show a 50 minute fight scene dropping right back into the marvel formula. Severely disappointed with the finale tainting the show in its entirety.
12 April 2021,7.7 but that's not an option,8.0,
26 February 2021,Insanely good omg!!!,10.0,I skipped episodes 1-3 after reading the reviews and boy this series is mindblowing! If you're a Marvel fan you're in for a treat! Love Kat Jennings!
16 July 2021,interesting for a marvel film,6.0,Interesting for a marvel film. Unique plot to watch .
5 March 2021,Making this show into a series instead of a movie was the right decision,9.0,"The storytelling was excellent. I did however struggle with some of the characters themselves (victimization is one thing but the blatant lack of accountability is becoming really problematic with Disney); but overall I had a great time. The cast was amazing, the acting was great, a few forced jokes here and there but nothing out proportion this time around. I'm really looking forward to what comes next."
16 January 2021,"HUH , WHAT!!!!",1.0,"I kinda watched the first episode then got 1/4 of the way through the second episode, then went to netflix , I've not a clue what it's about or where it's going and I really don't see the point of it , I can't even think of anything to say about it , just my personal opinion , whatever it is it's awful , if it had a taste it'd be like tofu unflavoured , or maybe I'm just to old to get it ,"
3 March 2021,For binge watchers only!,7.0,"This should have been released as a series in one binge-worthy extravaganza. As it is, this remarkable and highly original story will suffer the consequences of that shortsighted decision to release it in weekly bites.

The other important point about WandaVision is that as soon as you realize what's really going on, it quickly devolves into a standard cops and robbers 'guns a' blazing' nonsensical conspiracy theory.

Despite all that, it still deserves to be watched and is chock full of 'Easter eggs' and nice little surprises."
15 January 2021,Not more than a 6,6.0,"A 6 just because of being a MCU property and Connecting to MCU stories. Otherwise lazy writing and not worth the hype.

Could be watched for excellent acting.

P.S. if DC tries anything like this it will be hated by fans and critics, it's all so political."
7 March 2021,A wild ride ...into a dumpster.,5.0,"WandaVision actually starts off fairly interesting. The TV homage stuff is pretty entertaining and the ""mystery element"" keeps it watchable for the first few episodes. It's kinda fun and somewhat refreshing. But then it immediately crumbles. The uninspired twists and turns can be seen from miles away and yet they still didn't manage to get me invested in the characters or the plot during that time. They could have done so much based around the premise and these specific characters, but they chose to go down the same old road, which climaxed in an ""epic"" battle that felt small, boring and weightless. In the end. It's not bad, it's not good. It's vanilla. Soon, I will forget this show ever existed."
6 February 2021,Chills and thrills,10.0,Marvel studios never ceases to amaze. One of my favorite chapters in the cinematic universe so far!
21 January 2021,"Clichés, one after the other",4.0,"This show is really not funny. The production and imaging are amazing, but the plot is really lacking in quality. I am not sure what they are trying to achieve."
12 July 2021,Overall amazing,9.0,
8 March 2021,Alot of fuss aboit nothing.,3.0,I'll keep this short. Some movie's & tv shows you really enjoy & can rewatch over & over. Other's like this you wish you'd never heard of & you Wanda I'll never get that time back.
13 February 2021,Abandoning after Episode 6,6.0,"You will see a lot of reviews saying that you have to watch past episode 3 to see what's really going on and enjoy the show much more. The show certainly improves and makes a lot more sense from episode 4 onward.

However it is still mostly pretentious twaddle, just less boring. The meta-plot and the revealed reality are interesting, but can't save this fundamentally flawed offering.

It is hard to say if the acting is bad, or whether the script and storyline make successful acting impossible. Is someone's cackling laugh a failure to act, or does the script instruct them to ham it up, exaggerate for comedic effect? The attempts at humor frequently fall flat.

Our trip through the decades of different sitcom styles has been done lazily. They are supposedly being simultaneously celebrated, criticized, lampooned, re-invented and refreshed. This is at best half-effective. There should be be a goldmine of material to work with, but we just get cheap impersonations of classic characters.

The slow pacing and lack of imagination on the writer's part is supposed to be excused due to flaws and boredom in the original sitcom formats?

I have no particular interest in Marvel comics or know the specific characters they're showcasing here, so I'm reviewing this based on its fundamental entertainment value. Perhaps a MCU fan would appreciate it more. I couldn't even recommend it for children as it is I think supposed to be for adults who can sit through this dull show.

After seeing 6 episodes I can no longer be bothered. Even 3 amazing new episodes will not be able to compensate for the time I have wasted so far."
6 February 2021,Literally gets better every episode!,10.0,"Episode 1 and 2 was ehhh no the best, but starting at episode 3-4-5, its getting really exciting. This show went from ""Eh something to watch on fridays i guess"" to ""I wish everyday is friday""! Watch it!!"
8 March 2021,An OK mini-series,8.0,"Expanding on life after the last Avengers movie. While the first free episodes I did not find very much entertaining, but the remaining episodes were what you would expect from MCU type show. Good, if you want to watch some additional lore while waiting for the main instalments to arrive on the big screens."
31 January 2021,Amazing show!,10.0,"I love this show. Very refreshing, kinda strange and mysterious. Never seen anything like this before. I love it! I can't stop watchinnnggg

-x-"
19 February 2021,Disney shills out in force,3.0,
16 January 2021,"Amazing, different than any other thing marvel has ever done",10.0,The first 2 episodes were pretty great. I get the hate but just be patient. The first 2 episodes were the build-up for the next episodes.
20 January 2021,What happens when streaming services get greedy.,10.0,"These IGNORANT low reviews are what happens when streaming services stop releasing all the episodes at once. First of all, do any of these low rating reviews know ANYTHING about the storyline behind this show?!?! ""It's too much like I love Lucy"" "" I don't want a 60's sitcom"". For goodness sake shutup. From the start anyone with more than one brain cell knew what this show was going to be like. The people rating this show so low, off the first two episodes I'll add, are the same people who thought BvS(theatrical cut) was a masterpiece, and Captain Marvel was the strong woman we've been needing (GAG!!)"
4 February 2021,Don't like either of them.,9.0,"Both, Wanda and Vision seem pretty useless Avengers to me. They're the most forgettable of the lot and no one really cares about these two. What's shocking is them getting a damn show no one asked for. What's the need, honestly? Waste of money and waste of people's time. We could make do without these two characters in the franchise and no one would bat an eyelid, but despite this truth, how they get a show is beyond me. Too much spare (/black) money to burn?"
27 February 2021,Disapponting,1.0,I really wanted to like this show being a huge fan of the Marvel universe but WOW is this show bad. I really don't know what demographic this show was made for but it definitely is painful to try to watch. I think the actors did a fine job portraying their roles but everything else about this show is extremely disappointing. I really hope Loki is completely different than this series.
21 March 2021,Bewitched,3.0,This is a hodgepodge of bewitched/I love Lucy and a few other shows from the 60's-70's. As someone who grew up watching these type of shows l have to say BOOOOORING. I just watched episode 1 of Falcon and The Winter Soldier. Thats a Marvel comic show. This Wandavision made me want to gouge my eyes out
18 January 2021,How can you review it yet?,,"How can any right minded individual review a whole series 2 episodes in? Particularly a show like this that is very different and is clearly going to reveal more each week. You guys are breaking the rating system.

What we've seen so far is firmly in the style of Bewitched when it first aired. There are lots of nods to the fact it's about this and there's more to it but we've seen a huge amount of that yet either. Really it remains to be seen before anyone draws any conclusions. It is unlike anything else in Marvel or anywhere. It was fairly entertaining 2 episodes so far but I shall wait and see before drawing conclusions.

Ignore any score right now."
5 July 2021,"Very interesting plot and concept, even more interesting is to see which side people root for",8.0,"You can already tell that something is amidst within the first and second episode. Nonetheless, the suspense of the reveal of the main plot managed to keep me baffled still and at the edge of my seat the whole ride. Especially with the great acting from the cast, never expected any less from the cast for of the MCU franchise. Cannot wait to see what else is in store from the franchise after the series finale."
5 February 2021,Bad review? You're probably impatient or don't understand the show.,7.0,"(DO NOT LISTEN TO 1 STAR REVIEWS!) First off, I don't like sitcoms, they just aren't for me. The first or second episode starts off the main plot and it's slowly taking up more and more run time of each episode. I was hooked since episode 1 cause I need to know what's going on, if you're trying this show, get to episode 4 or 5 before deciding to stop watching it, that's when things really pick up. All of the 1 star reviews are just impatient people or people who don't understand what's going on and they're mad over their own confusion."
16 January 2021,Wish this was a movie,4.0,"I am sure this is going to take an interesting turn, and Disney did well to release the second trailer before everybody just gives up. However, the first two episodes just drag on and unless you're a fan of flat sitcom humour or a hard-core Marvel fan boy you sit through 95% of boredom and 5% of attempts to create intrigue. Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"
19 February 2021,ignore the haters,9.0,"What is with all the negative reviews? this show is awesome and the all the haters have problems. this was episode was funny and THAT ending, omg. i just want next friday to be here already. and finally, post credit scenes are back to the MCU."
15 January 2021,Most inventive thing MCU has ever done,6.0,"WandaVision is just fabulous, creative mashup of genres and it blows. In first 2 episodes, they used the usual sitcom couple dynamics and clichés of any regular sitcom with Wanda and Vision's unusual powers and its damn funny. There are even laugh tracks to get into the feel. There's mystery, intrigue and much more. Next episode can't come soon enough."
26 January 2021,An astoundingly misjudged misfire,4.0,"Well, this review is based on sitting through the first three episodes, so around 80 or 90 minutes of 'story', and almost nothing at all has happened so far.

It's fairly obvious that the premise for the show was taken/stolen from two sources: the 1998 movie Pleasantville, and one or two of the odder stand-alone episodes of Buffy The Vampire Slayer (notice the Emma Caulfield cameo?). OK, and a smidgen of The Truman Show in there too. But whereas Buffy could make it work throwing reality-shifting left turns into a larger story arc, because of such strong and well-loved-and-established characters and the history we have with them, this one drops us into an appallingly boring parody of a bad TV show, with no-one to connect to or root for. These are two fairly minor characters in the Avengers movies, who we never got to really know or connect to there anyway, but here they are not even anything like THEM: neither of them shows any individuality or true feeling, or even reminds us of their big screen characters at all. And since the rest of the presented world is intentionally (and gratingly) artifical, that means we are watching just... nothing.

If they had set up a season or two establishing Wanda and Vision as recognizable individuals we can care for, then throwing them into this strange alternate world we want them to awake from, especially if it is also peopled by other characters we have a history with, then perhaps it could have worked. But THERE ARE NO CHARACTERS! Paul Bettany, especially, seems to be just reading the ridiculous script with no idea of anything that is going on and then trying out funny voices, but Elizabeth Olsen too just looks like she is sitting in on some random sketches on Saturday Night Live. There is an absolute absence of any actual story for the length of time of a full theatrical movie.

Admittedly, there are maybe two or three minutes in total where something unusual happens as the real world breaks in, but they are surrounded by an absolute ocean of interminable inanity, so one's patience is exhausted even after the first 10 minutes. No tension is built up, as the sit-com parts just run on and on and on and on and on and on and on with no subtext or clues to further events or depths beyond the stupid world they're trapped in. The makers seem to have thought people would lap up detailed reconstructions of Bewitched and I Love Lucy-type sitcoms from the past when remade without any charm or actual humour, but they misjudged this terribly, as most of the other reviews here show.

My thinking is it would have worked as a few issues of a long-established comic book, but it is as boring and drawn out a mess as has maybe ever been shown on TV as a miniseries. I would say I applaud them for trying something different, but as I pointed out at the beginning, there's nothing really original here at all, it's just an awful, yawning empty void, and I'm yawning right back."
29 January 2021,Predictable roller coaster.,5.0,"It presents itself like this fresh mystery/thriller but it's the same old ride. Pleasantville, The Truman show and many Sci-Fi/Fantasy dramas come to mind.

Really it's tropey, cookie cutter, check box diversity with middling acting. The tension is a doubled edged sword, it fluctuating between excitement and anxiety inducing.

I was left wondering if it's actually exciting or is it just the rapid pace, tense music and attachment to the intriguing fandom?

The first few episodes are bland and over rely on the ""unique"" concept but the series does pick up a few notches in later episodes.

The mystery elements weren't to hard to solve either so it felt like I was just going along for the ride on a slightly tweaked roller coaster I rode before.

I expected more nuance, depth and character from a property that has such a wellspring to draw from but I can see how it could be entertaining for the busy person/family wanting to fill some time with some superhero drama but this feels like the plateau of the MCU.

It's like a casual fine dining restaurant. It's better than fastfood, it's tasty but safe and predictable, there are other options and you can live with or without it."
26 January 2021,"You're kidding me, right?",1.0,"I've been a Marvel fan for years, ever since I was able to hold a comic book I was fascinated by the notion of super powers.

Now of course, I know they're not real, but I still look forward to new releases in the theater and also take in reruns on TV when I can.

But this? Who ever thought it up should not ever be the ""go to"" person for new ideas. The entire notion of a 'Bewitched meets I Love Lucy meets Dick Van Dyke' borders on insanity. Maybe if we all hadn't see the two leads in multiple movies would've made the idea fresher, but it's too late.

Save the 30 minutes for something more interesting like watching plants grow in your garden or see how long it takes for a teaspoon of water to evaporate. At least then you'd be more entertained than this colossal flop IMO."
27 March 2021,"Great story, but not satisfying enough...",7.0,
9 May 2021,MCU TV shows are off to a good start!,9.0,
15 January 2021,Hmmmm. Interesting.,,Being a big Marvel nerd i was sceptical about this show. Watched the first episode and as much as i was a bit annoyed by it i was also intrigued. By the end of the second i was more intrigued. I can't help but think it is going to get very good despite not enjoying the first 2 episodes much. Stick with it i think. Also not very funny.
29 January 2021,IT STARTED TO SHIFT LIKE THE TECTONIC PLACTES,9.0,Just watched episode 4. Wow. It was really something. The show started picking up after episode 3. It's really good.
5 March 2021,Absolutely Unnecessary,1.0,
30 March 2021,Boring,3.0,
3 May 2021,I Love Wanda!,7.0,"Having just watched Falcon and the Winter Soldier, I realized I never reviewed this! WandaVision is great, not quite as good as FandWS but it's also not trying to deal with the same weight of subject matter. Still, it's great fun, phenomenal to look at, seriously only Disney would throw the kind of money needed at this to make it look like it does.

Where WV loses points though is in the pacing. First two episodes are great little pieces of retro tv nostalgia and then we move into a few episodes that feel like the series meandering a bit before we finally dive into the real meat of it all. Those meandering episodes are a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but they don't feel entirely necessary either.

Still, great watch and absolutely recommend it."
16 January 2021,Rubbish,1.0,"My kids turned it off after 20 minutes, I sat through the entire 1st episode and what a waste of time that was, black and white 1950's sitcom garbage"
23 August 2021,WandaVision is one of the most unique MCU stories!,9.0,"With brilliant performances, WandaVision manages to make you anxious with the mysteries it presents.

More than a superhero story, it's a true tribute to television history!

Even doing different things, Marvel Studios hit the nail once again!"
6 March 2021,It was alright,6.0,"I thought the finale would've been better. I got really hyped up for it but it didn't seem as good as the series built it up to be. I love Wanda; she's awesome. I even got over the silly cheesiness throughout the series to love this show but it wasn't as good as I anticipated :/ Anyways, I guess I'll give it a 6.5/10. Also, Olsen is a great actress and I hope she does some major role smashing in the future! She really is a very talented actress and I can't wait to see more of her outside of Disney/Marvel. Thanks for reading. -Sina"
18 July 2021,A Good Start for the MCU on Disney+,7.0,"Excellent casting, and the sit-com send-up was inspired. I enjoyed the slow-burn mystery tone that the show starts off with, but it's body-checked off course by the unnecessary inclusion of SWORD.

SWORD, effectively a spin-off of SHIELD, and its police procedural elements just take up a lot of unnecessary space that could have been spent on Wanda's family and neighbours for a more engaging resolution of the story arc.

In hindsight, casting Evan Peters was clever, and a let down as an opportunity to connect the events of Wandavision with the events of Loki."
17 January 2021,Totally confused,1.0,"It's marvel comic! Wanda and vision! Avengers!!! What is all this? Sitcom, comedy please you have mature audience who what's excitement, action, suspense, link up with other avengers not this 70s theme not funny monochrome pictures."
8 February 2021,"Boring 5 episodes, the comedy doesn't hit right",4.0,"Very bland. Some dark moments were hinted at in episodes 1 to 3 but all of it evaporated instantly with a massive exposition dump of episode 4.

The comedy doesn't hit right, a few good jokes here and there; but tonally it is mismatched with the action hero and dark themes that the show claims to portray.

Overall the biggest crime was committed with it being largely boring.

4/10 below average show, nothing special. I didn't give a 5 because I won't be watching the next 3 episodes, I stopped caring already."
15 January 2021,Did you watched series Trailer at all???,7.0,
16 January 2021,Wandavision more like Wandaturnitoff,1.0,What can I say about a show that uses concepts from the past........that its best to be left in the past.
30 January 2021,THE BEST SITCOM EVER,10.0,
15 January 2021,Don't Bother,3.0,"Sometimes that ""bright"" idea or ""new approach is simply a bust. Watched first episode and both kids left the room 10 minutes in. Crossing my fingers it gets better..."
3 April 2021,Didn't know what it wanted to be,7.0,"We start from Legion-style quirkyness and end up at full on Marvel Avengers mode cinematography.

This series didn't know what it wanted to be and the beginning I'm sure alienated a lot of the audience.

Watchable and yet another springboard for odd Marvel characters as per usual.

I wasn't impressed although it was refreshing to see a protagonist that is not a hero or a villain but a troubled soul."
25 April 2021,Shockingly cringy,3.0,"Big payday for actors to portray unlikeable characters. I cringed with this season, if there's another one they really need a believable antagonist."
26 November 2021,Episodes: 1-9,9.0,"Wow! What a pleasant surprise, MCU continues to impress me with their out-of-the-box imagination and breathtaking storytelling. Everything about this mini-series screaming with perfection and I'm all here for it."
16 January 2021,Different and Astonishingly Amazing,9.0,The first two episodes were different and amazing. I loved how they brought up 60s tv sit-com concept. The dialogues and the character's interaction were amazing. I'm getting feeling like all these stuff and happy couple in suburbia is dream. Wanda imagining all these stuffs. I hope there is a twist to the story or it'll look completely stupid. It's not fair to judge an entire season by only two episodes but these two episodes completely set it up for great season. I'm expecting good stuff and hoping remaing episodes to be enthralling.
13 June 2022,It was mostly fun to watch,7.0,"You could clearly understand the plot and the plot twists, but it was fun to watch the episodes. Sometimes it was a bit slow in the progression.

Lovely characters and very well written. Excellent explanation of Wanda's emotions and backstory

Nice CGI and the tribute to the old sitcoms was amazing."
16 January 2021,"Against my expectations, I enjoyed the first 2 episodes",9.0,"I feel that this idea: using the marvel universe as a springboard to develop content for all ages, is good. The Mandalorian has proved that this can work, and, I think there is a lot of potential for this approach in Disney's Marvel works. I will post more when the show ends, who knows, they could still cock up the rest of the series."
16 March 2021,MCU storytelling told through a different lens.,9.0,
1 July 2021,"Bold mix of genres, enjoyable but not rewatchable",6.0,"Even though I say it's bold of Marvel to mix genres like this, they've already seen it done well in Parasite - and I'm venturing to guess that Parasite's success was part of the reason behind this experimentation. (This show literally went into production a month after Parasite was released and won all those awards)

On the plus side, the action is enjoyable even if there is very little in the show. I also like how there is a clear plot with hashed out character motivations.

Is the plot good? Not really. It is so simple you wonder if a 5 year old put out the story board, but it serves its purpose to explore Wanda and Vision's relationship.

The villain was above average in quality for Marvel villains, but I couldn't really care less about what happened to the villain, or any of the characters in this show for that matter.

The acting is the biggest part of what makes this show go from tolerable to enjoyable, but the rudimentary plot, low stakes and slow pacing would make any rewatch of this show a total nightmare."
8 February 2021,Wow!!! Just Wow!!,10.0,
6 March 2021,Complete surprise,9.0,"I must admit, I was more than a little sceptical when I saw the first episodes. Pretty upset really, it sucked. But I was wrong, didn't expect a slow build up like this, cause I never saw anything like it. When the fun started it went all the way fast. Will recommend this to whomever wants to hear it. Great show, but you need a bit more patience than you're used to need for a Marvel product."
27 February 2021,Please please please be patient with the first three episodes,9.0,It just blew my mind to see everything coming together. The performances are just brilliant and Elizabeth Olsen has given a performance of her lifetime and it shows. Lot of reveals and easter eggs. Keep 'em coming.
22 July 2022,The visión.,10.0,
12 February 2021,Mind blending,10.0,"Ignore all the negative reviews, focus every single details they show and wait for episode 4..and episode 6 will surely explode you head.. My god this is the only show that give me goes bump after Game of Thrones."
14 February 2021,Olsen is spellbinding,10.0,"Great premise for a show and a brave start knowing negative reviews would be flooding in prior to episode 4. Stick with it as this just gets better and better with a heartfelt progression and a sinister undertone. The two stars are perfect for these split personality roles, Paul Bettany with his smooth, charming alter ego and Elizabeth Olsen is purely mesmerising on screen as she struggles between keeping it together and not suffering fools easily.

No idea where this will go if it went to a season 2 but I hope they manage to write something and not finish on what could be a sad ending for all. Come on Lizzie, rooting for you!"
17 February 2021,Thor got fat Wanda did this,9.0,
22 June 2021,Get past the first few eps.... Trust me.,9.0,"If I had quit watching after the first episode and missed out on this masterpiece, it would have been a travesty. I love anything Marvel and this just gives me that little slice of heaven I needed after the last movie. I was devastated and this is beautiful."
25 April 2021,complete garbage aside from the last two episodes,,
7 February 2021,good series with twists and turns,10.0,
2 February 2021,It all makes sense now!!!!,10.0,"Oh wow!!!! This was Genius! I cant wait for the next one! Pay attention to every detail in the first episodes, I promise you will understand in episode 4!"
9 April 2021,"Are you people insane? No, really I'm asking.",1.0,"This show is trash. Complete and utter GARBAGE.

This is NOT what could have been a very good Marvel show with the original actors. It is a very confusing attempt at being a 50's sitcom based on Marvel characters with extremely flat humor.

I did NOT drink the Koolaid and will not be participating in the false hype that this drivel has inspired.

The worst part is I pretty much guarantee they will make another season, or even several. Popularity is what matters after all..."
15 January 2021,Really weird and kinda sucks,2.0,To be fair I've only seen the (pretty terrible) first episode and if my opinion will change i will change this review
16 January 2021,Marvel doing it right,6.0,"The trailers did not mislead. This show does not disappoint. After a dozen or so marvel universe installments, which were either a shameless money grab or overzealousness on the part of the writers and the studio to really unfold the intricate and layered story of the fictional charatcers we all love, I genuinely thought that the planned spin-offs would flop. And while being cautious, because let's face it, we're only two episodes in, I am utterly excited and enthused. This show, thus far, is amazing. The beauty of supporting characters in any huge cast story is that thay are basicly a blank slate. They have no canonical story, which is why the corresponding comics are so entertaining and partly the reason why this show is so damn creative and fresh. It's comical, lovely with just a hint of something darker looming in the background. I sincerely hope that the show won't take a turn for the over-the-top, over-dramatized tone of the late marvel universe movies. This show is a breath of fresh air; it's quirky, funny, creative, thoroughly enjoyable. Tip of the hat to the creators. And a firm yes to anyone who's wondering, should they watch it."
10 March 2021,Its just beautiful,10.0,"Seriously taken ! Perfectly executed ! Intelligent story .....Glued from 1 to 9 , wandavision is probably a great ode to the epicness of endgame ."
17 January 2021,Not what it seems,10.0,Don't give up and think this is a waste of time. You would think it's just a mock sitcom on Wanda and vision but there is more than it seems...
6 March 2021,Slow start. Disappointing finish,6.0,
6 March 2021,Boring,3.0,"None of the characters in this are sympathetic. Could not have cared less which character won any of the fights. Kathryn Hahn is amazing - hers was the only character with any style or flash. I'd watch a spinoff with her as the star but otherwise, snoozefest."
17 January 2021,Whats the Vision behind making of WandaVision,3.0,Whats going on with this B/W showing on half screen and with annoying laughing background on the jokes which aren't worth laughing. If all the 9 episodes are like these old time boring laughter shows god helps us.
15 January 2021,Is this is a joke?,1.0,"That s was my impression when i watched the first 2 episode ,one is barely 30 minutes and i get bored after 15 ,,you can skip easily to the last 3 minutes of both episode without losing nothing ,is this series will be Wanda and Vision revisiting ""I love Lucy"" Bewitched "" and probably next "" happy days "" ""Mork and Mindy"" etc etc until they will get away to this ""reality"" ....no thanks"
19 February 2021,A review of every episode and the series as a whole,8.0,
17 January 2021,Nostalgia vs Cringe,6.0,"If you Love Lucy, and understand that statement you'll probably like this show. If you don't understand it or were expecting Marvel's superheroes doing anything but wink at the fourth wall the whole time with ""old timey"" jokes, just re-watch ANYTHING else Marvel. First few minutes were good for a cute peek into the 1950's sitcoms, after 2 episodes it's lost it's charm and needs more Marvel and less Beaver."
23 February 2021,1 less star for wasting too much time at first.,9.0,"This show is superb except for how they handle the pacing at the beginning, and unfortunately the bad reviews just poured in. Now it is looking very good and I'm glad that I stayed with it. The way they adopted different era of television traditions to form a unique show is really something quite experimental for a superhero show. I'm sure that they are going to be keeping up with the good work and now I grant it a solid nine before the show is over."
16 February 2021,"Well written, sublimely executed",9.0,"I can't speak for the reviews that bash this show for the first three episodes. All I can say is that the writing is on the wall from episode one. All is not what it seems. Once the veil is lifted, you get what you've been craving for since Infinity War (but didnt know you wanted). Dark, visceral, vulnerable, delicate. I read the reviews and honestly, the negative ones made me want to watch this even more. It honestly delivers in more ways than one. If you've followed the Marvel Universe, this satisfies that need to see something obtuse, yet connected. Well done Disney and Marvel for continuing to respect the fandom surrounding the characters and creations you've made us grow to love. Genuinely entertaining and worthy of any Marvel fan's viewing. Looking forward to more."
4 March 2021,Must watch,10.0,This is an absolute brilliant TV Show if you are a marvel fan then it is a treat for you
16 January 2021,First two episodes definitely a one,1.0,"The first two episodes are probably the worse television I have ever seen, how can you ask people to preserver after watching this rubbish?"
17 January 2021,Give it a chance,8.0,"Judging by the numerous trailers, I wasn't expecting an action superhero movie or something, people should have known that, that's what trailers are for. Marvel tries something new, weird, unique and fantasical as well as staying true to the classic sitcom era. The first two episodes may by for everyone's liking, but I think it's too soon to judge the series in whole. On the outside, it's all campy, whimsical and light-hearted but underneath it's a psychological thriller mystery that's building up to something much more darker than we've ever seen before in MCU. Give it a chance people."
5 May 2021,Well impressed,8.0,"I watched this with an open mind, taking into account that this is not long after the 'blip' ... first couple of episodes are very confusing but again watch open minded, after that everything becomes clear and the series as a whole is really good. It's a must watch for fans, as this will slip in nicely with Marvels phase 4."
15 January 2021,Confused,8.0,"Seriously, what happened here? There was not much more story as in the trailer. Every MCU nerd on YouTube was able to give me more from the trailer as these two episodes told me yet. I hope they'll got better within the next episodes. At the moment it seems a bit going into the long tail but chances are also given that this could get rubbish. We'll see"
5 March 2021,It's hard to believe that Marvel went for a crazy show like this,9.0,"I didn't think that Marvel could actually make something crazy like this. People rating the show negatively after just watching the first 2 episodes screwed up big time. By the end of the show, WandaVision became quintessential Marvel, and it's safe to say that this was an goddamn amazing start for Phase 5."
17 January 2021,A sitcom?,9.0,"Being a fan on the Marvel Universe I was looking forward to this series. After watching two episodes I cannot express the level of my disappointment. It is presented as a 1950's style Sitcom in black and white. Why? I really like Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany but I cannot stomach this abysmal mistake.

Edited: While the first three or four episodes were difficult to watch the subsequent episodes and the explanation for the earliest episodes. It became one of the most imaginative series I have had the pleasure to watch. I recommend this one highly."
16 January 2021,People don't get it,10.0,"I see so many comments saying 1/10 because it was so boring and just not funny, and it baffles me how people don't understand. It's supposed to be like a 50s sitcom and they did a phenomenal job. That's how old sitcoms were, really cheesy jokes. But when you look past that and notice the weird and eerie stuff going on and the hidden meanings in the dialogue, it's an amazing show imo. I saw one review say how the show is supposed to be a comedy and how he didn't laugh at all but it's not suppose to be a comedy, maybe the first 2 episodes were, but that was 50s humor and I think they did a great job with it. As the show progresses, it will get more and more serious and odd (in a good way) and hopefully people will realize that they judged it too soon."
6 February 2021,Brilliantly Odd Masterpiece,10.0,"This show was created to be unlike anything we've ever seen in the MCU. It is brilliant, strange, wild, creative, and just a plain masterpiece. I have to be honest, I was not following the first episode. I was skeptical of everything, even after the 2nd episode. True fans will stick with it, though, and it is so worth it. After watching episodes 4 & 5, I cannot wait to see what happens next! This show will be able to open up so much more. The ONLY thing I wish was that there was more than 1 episode a week."
7 March 2021,Good but not what you expect.,5.0,"Okay. I may be a little harsh here but aside the emotions of Infinity war and Endgame, this was not i was expecting. I think they could have just kept it simple and entertaining. Acting is good, it is upto the mark. Writing i think could have been better. Direction too. But in all it is a good popcorn watch just for once. No moments are boring, humour is good too. One should certainly watch it."
27 February 2021,"Very, very average.",8.0,Don't believe the hype. It's a movie chopped into TV sized chunks which would have been great but it's not a good story or even particularly interesting. Why they can' just follow the comics is beyond me. Huge amounts of great source material all wasted.
16 January 2021,I need a back story,8.0,"I'm enjoying the fun throw back since I am old enough to remember sitcoms of old... But what's the back story, how, what, where did they come from, why? They don't seem to even know who or what they are! Maybe it will unfold somehow but I sure feel like there's a huge chunk of something missing! Oh well, let's hope for the best."
15 January 2021,Nice but not upto that enjoyable mark,1.0,Not good Only the reason that the series is in hype beacuse of marvel because after Endgame marvel become overrated don't waste your time in this show
27 January 2021,If I'd never seen any Marvel before I'd have probably dodged all of it from just 2 episodes!,5.0,"The need for trying ""something new"" whilst copying ""something old"" is definitely a weird choice. The first 2 episodes whilst intriguing and a nice clap back to 50's sitcom were (I hate to say it) subpar. It's not as if it's building tension? Whilst comical in places it felt like it dragged! Rated a 5 as I'm sure it will get better but I'm very much still on the fence. It seems like disney are going to drag more and more weekly episodes out to keep people subscribed. ""Who's hurting you Wanda?"" Disney is the answer! This should have definitely been an entire season release. Here's to the next few episodes."
7 February 2021,Marvel did best things ever in series all so,10.0,
1 March 2021,Great story,8.0,"Great TV series, has wishing Friday was here today. Story was carefully crafted and will leave a viewer guessing."
24 January 2021,"Don't be lazy, enjoy the show",9.0,"I see people saying ""not necessary"" ""we want action"" ""don't care about black and white"". Be curious, come on! Enjoy the show, enjoy the game (because that's what it is) and don't be so lazy. It's obvious something is going to happen so let's wait and see. I do like MCU and this is probably the most interesting thing I've seen, stands out from the others. Not to mention the acting in good and details are great."
18 January 2021,Marvel fan,5.0,"I dont know why are people separated when it comes to DC and Marvel. I love both. Watch all the shows, well 90% of them. Im not gonna watch this one sadly. The pilot should be one of the best episodes when a show starts, but this one really does nothing. Clues and all the little trinkets people see mean nothing, the story is the one driving everything broadcasted on TV, not hidden clues only few notice. I do not like the format at all. This is coming from someone who watches almost everything Marvel puts out. Ill give it a shot one more time around mid-season.. if it even stays alive that long.

P.S. after watching the whole thing I can only confirm what I've already said. No, it doesn't get more interesting after ep 3. Imagine having to watch fake commercials inside a fake tv show that is inside a real tv show. Everything is wrong in this Wandavision series. I hope they won't make new seasons. It's honestly boring from the first to the last episode."
17 January 2021,Too Early to Tell After 2 Episodes,6.0,"6/10 after two episodes is fair. Anything higher, especially the 9/10 reviews you're seeing or the 1/10, are just exaggeration at this early point of the show.

We all know the premise, they're stuck in some Matrix/Truman Show/Insert your own version type of experiment and are trying to understand where they are. The problem is, despite the short run time, 22 mins, is that the first two episodes dragged and are relying upon little Easter eggs to keep you hooked. It's pretty boring but you know/hope it will get better. Disney & Marvel have invested too much for their first Marvel show to be a flop... The Mandalorian it is not. And it could have been."
15 January 2021,One of the best and most creative things Marvel has ever done!,10.0,"First off, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS! The people who gave it bad reviews either don't appreciate the beautiful tribute to the eras of sitcoms and television or they live underground where they don't understand or appreciate it. This show is so unique and creative that it absorbs us in this wonderful fantasy world that provides a heart-warming experience with a hint of something sinister to come. I am a big movie buff and I'm an extreme marvel fan and I truly believe this is one of the best things marvel has done. The acting, story, editing, the mystery, the humor, everything is so perfect. It really honors all eras of sitcoms and television in a beautiful way in this story full of pure love and happiness."
29 January 2021,Brilliant Marvel,10.0,An amazing show unlike any other. WOw it amazes me so much that I sit here every week just wanting more and more of the clues. Sad people dont get how brilliant it is??
2 March 2021,Unique.,9.0,"I'm not a Big fan of Marvel but This show is something else, Unique."
21 August 2021,Was Really Loving it Until I Didn't Really Love It,8.0,
16 January 2021,hmmmm,1.0,"After 10 minutes, I was wondering what I was watching and why was wondering I watching it? The actors are obviously good, but the writer, hmmm, why do they keep hiring non comic fans to write comics films, programs? Is this not like hiring a brick layer to make a cake? I mean he puts bits like ingredients together to make cement! I don't understand why film makers keep making films, programs as if they were made in the 30's, 50's, 70's etc film makers made these films, programs back then because of the technology they had, if they all had the equipment we have now, all the past programs would not look the way they do, there would be no silent films, square box films, grainy films etc Again a writer who does not care about the fans and what they might like, but what she likes. Maybe it will get better, but usually you have to grab peoples attention early on and this was so lack lustre and uninteresting and I am a comic fan. I really don't believe all these 10/10 reviews, don't seem plausible to me and I'm a fanboy, or should I say fanperson, or fanbeing as even perSON has the male term in there. Really let down, but there is some good news about this, the cast are good and it can't get any worse from here on out (I think)."
19 February 2021,Worth Your Time. Definitely. Marvel Never Let Me Down,,"At first it seems so strange and confusing but after the third episode everything starts to make sense, they slowly reveal everything which makes it even more interesting. When you come to the seventh episode you will be shocked and you will see that it was worth your time."
7 March 2021,amazing,10.0,"Slow starting but once it's on episode 4 it's amazing, many complain about the loose ends of the finale however it's the start of phase 4 so it's setting up for different movies/series to come."
11 July 2021,A fantastically original and emotional Marvel TV show,9.0,"I didn't have high hopes for WandaVision following the trailers with the black and white 1950s sitcom feel, but it's a fantastically original and emotional TV show. The idyllic 1950s Westview setting in episodes 1 and 2 were sweet and fun to watch, but it was quickly established that all was not as it seemed. It was also curious that Vision didn't know that he was, well, deceased, following Endgame.

The weekly release of episodes kept the mystery alive by developing the story slowly, which satisfied my Marvel craving and made the series a worthwhile addition to the MCU..."
16 January 2021,Its not a 10 but not a 1,10.0,
23 April 2021,Good characters very well performed but they cant save it!,5.0,
29 January 2021,"It's... everything. I love everything about it. It's light, creative and nostalgic,",10.0,I can't ever afford a house like that but god damn I can see myself In my dreams and imagination having this life and it feels so humble.
5 March 2021,Decent but also disappointing,6.0,"The show starts off slow, the first 4 episodes are a waste like nothing happens the story. It didn't progress but after that it gets better and takes a really good turn up until episode 8. The finale was decent but kind of disappointing, some good action scenes but the show lacked from having anything which can shock or some good twists and they didn't even solve all the questions. People that are rating this show 10 is because it's a marvel show. Disappointed go watch AOT it's way better than this."
29 January 2021,Series review,10.0,One of the best series for recommendations and unique containt
30 December 2021,Maybe the worst marvel show.... haven't watched falcon and the winter soldier yet...,8.0,"Maybe the worst show Marvel has ever produced... Just waiting to watch the next maybe Trash or a good series from the same company that is falcon and the winter soldier.

BTW Loki was good."
16 January 2021,Fanboys: Good and bad,9.0,"First off ignore the 10 ratings and the 1's and 2's (my 7 is provisional just to fill a field) They are from Marvel fanboys who will rate everything 10 as long as it's not DC and from MCU film fans who just didn't get this yet. The same thing happened after one episode of one of the best TV show of the last 10 years, Watchmen. Idiots on both sides of the fence.

The amount of stupid negative comments don't surprise me though. Marvel have taken a chance to do some different and interesting and it's obviously gone over the heads of the average MCU (film/TV) fans who want fly fly, punch punch, zap zap. Some of the comments ""the MCU wasn't set in the 50's"" or ""is this a comedy? Because I didn't laugh"" have really missed the point that there is something afoot, something bigger going on, something traumatic that Wanda is protecting herself from. A larger story will unfold for those who have a tiny bit of patience (Christ there's only been two eps) and an attention span longer than a goldfish.

Both Olsen and Bettany are brilliant, absolutely throwing themselves into their I Love Lucy/Bewitched constructs but also playing it as in universe actors playing a part, either by choice or necessity of survival. Olsen in particular channels the duality really well. She's magnetic as usual.

As I said it's different and interesting and I'm delighted they went (a lot) left of center with this. I do expect it will move closer to what we're used to, and in universe reality, as the series progresses. So ignore the 10's and 1's and go look for yourself with an open mind to something a little different. I'm on board, I liked it a lot."
16 January 2021,Optimistic but not satisfied.,6.0,"If this was released as a movie or all episodes at once, people would've been satisfied. After waiting a year without any marvel content these two episodes were a letdown for me. Lots and lots of unnecessary scenes made it a little boring. Only good and important things are at the end of each episodes. Rest of the episode is time stretching only. I think the show will be good in the future. But not for the time being. I know black and white has something to do about the storytelling, going from 50s to 60s etc. But B&W and also 50s sitcom style made it a little bit boring as I have not watched any B&W sitcoms and not from US. This confirms ""Marvel movies are good but not TV"" mantra furthermore to me. But hey it's only two episodes and I'm pretty optimistic for future MCU."
11 June 2021,Good Start Bad Finish,5.0,The show started out with original ideas and good character development. But then they caught on rabbit trails and couldn't find their way back to the story.
6 February 2021,Extremely strange... but very well made,9.0,"Marvel has once again worked their magic, this time on the small screen. Though the show starts out slow, with the first three episodes barely including anything that resembles a plot, the fourth and fifth episodes masterfully tie everything together while not feeling too plot-heavy.

While the effectiveness of Marvel's idea to mix the eras of television could be up for debate, they have expertly intertwined characters not only from the main avengers story arc, but from the wider range of the Marvel comics characters. Good job, Marvel. You've done it again."
30 June 2021,Simply amazing.,10.0,"Copared to the mess that the Falcon and the Winter solider are,and that the Loki is at the moment , this one is a masterpiece."
5 March 2021,A superhero movie shoehorned into a half baked concept based on a clever title.,4.0,"It would be too easy to just say the show is awful, or the whole affair is empty. Yet it may be fair to say it emphasizes style over substance.

Don't get me wrong, it tries. It tries oh so hard. As does Elizabeth Olsen, the actress playing Wanda.

The underdevelopment of a character that must carry a multidimensional tone but written and performed as an off key singular note is problematic.

It is hard to blame Ms. Olsen's caricature of the 50s housewife and lack of comedic likeability of a Mary Tyler Moore, Elizabeth Montgomery or a Lucille Ball but it is painfully evident. Ultimately it is too tough of a mashup to pull off for almost anyone, let alone Ms.Olsen. (Whom I have adored throughout her career.)

A storyline that is ultimately about loss and it's psychological effects could of been a rich area to mine with depth beyond any film from the MCU.

Yet the construct of aping old classic sitcoms through the decades falls flat. They may achieve the look of each decade with robotic precision but the tone is all wrong. It is all window dressing for big action but ultimately a shallow exercise.

It all comes back to the writing. There is no real sense of heart. Tons of plot, very little heart. More vulnerability may have balanced this odd tone but who knows?

The time and length of storytelling they go through to reveal a tiny morsel of connective tissue to string the series together is downright infuriating. The first three episodes are a borefest. Not until episode four does the show reveal anything worth mentioning.

The show started to become tolerable when Monica Rambeau's backstory is revealed in the fourth episode. After displaying depth and a multilayered approach in this frame, they u-turn right back to the odd mashup of light sitcom, military heroism with faux melancholy in the following episodes.

The show is odd and I give them credit for taking a swing, but the awful writing is so hard to overcome.

The one dimensional cardboard character of Military Director Heyward and his cliché war monger heavy is laughable and seems abrupt and out of touch with this fantastical event they are witnessing.

Yet there are some bright spots. Paul Bethany has the ability to overcome the writing and saves just about every scene he is in with his light wit, charm and screen presence.

Teyonah Paris and Randal Park are good in their supporting roles. Yet it is KAT Dennings that truly shines in her supporting spot, she steals scenes and lights up the screen. When paired with Paul Bethany you have the makings of something special.

It feels as though Marvel had a gimmick and tried to shoehorn a superhero movie inside of a half baked concept based on a clever title. Although parts of WandaVision are unique and there are inspired moments (too few) it is tough to give this bombastic convoluted effort more than a middling review.

Yet those moments are far too few to save WandaVision."
19 January 2021,First episode full bad. Second slightly improved.,1.0,"There's a long way to go to make it good.

There's just no context for the setting so it feels 100% forced.

The humour is purposely corny but it is grating throughout. Rather than emulating the classics, it feels like a failed Disney Kids network show."
25 March 2021,Strong Start Underwhelming Ending,6.0,
20 February 2021,Mind blowing,10.0,Just watch it u won't regret it... I bet that... Bcz I never intended to watch this.. From the beginning ( when WV series officially announced) I was only watching breakdowns.. But after the 3rd ep.. I couldn't stop myself from watching it.. It's like a rollercoaster ride.. ❤ I can say it's the most interesting and mysterious creation of Marvel..
15 January 2021,Pretty satisfying so far,8.0,"The two episodes, even though short, deliver quite the bizarreness that revolves around Wanda and Vision. The whole vibe of the show is intriguing and interesting, the setting is pretty believable as well. Not sure why people expected action from the first episode. Action without meaning is not okay. Giving 8 for the short duration of the episodes (cmon, they could have been a little bit more extended) and for the absence of cutscene after the credits (this is not very MCU in my opinion). Pretty excited for what will they deliver. Finally these two characters will have a proper introduction to the universe."
24 January 2021,Before complaining.. remember this is Wanda's Vision,10.0,
2 March 2021,Completely Overrated.,,"Love me the 11 year run of MCU but this show will NOT hold up well. People are raving because there has been a Marvel drought and we all need our fix. 66% of WandaVision's run time could be cut and you would lose nothing. How did they spend 200 million on a lot of nothing? Was cast salaries that large? This would have made a cool 2 hour movie. Instead they drag out and leak out nonsensical, uninteresting filler. Years from now NO ONE will want to rewatch this series. Period. Says it all right there..."
6 March 2021,Entertaining addition to the MCU,8.0,
24 January 2021,Little bit weird,7.0,The first 3 episodes are a little bit weird. I wonder what will happen when the twist comes. I am suprised by Elizabeth Olsens good acting work
2 February 2021,Marvel can never be great,2.0,"If Disney would have just come out of the blue with a new science fiction TV show in an I Love Lucy style comedy setting, I would be the first to appreciate that risky venture.

But this is Marvel. There is no gamble. Despite what people are saying, there is no risk, no re-definition, this is not ground-breaking. It's just freaking Marvel. They can do I whatever they want, cram as many genres as they want into the M'C'U, and legions of fans-the same ones who dubbed the visual slop that was Avengers Endgame one of the greatest movies ever-will show up anyway to get their superhero high. Even worse, these shows are degrading and/or killing off classic movie and TV genres with these hollow attempts to do something 'new', and actual, better works in the genre will be ignored because people get dumbed down by these stupid superheroes.

No need to watch westerns when you can watch Logan. No need to watch heist movies when you can watch Ant-Man. No need to watch war movies when you can watch Captain America or Wonder Woman. No need to watch comedies when you can watch the Marvel movies. No need to watch action movies when you can watch superheroes.

This is as much a criticism of superhero obsessions as it is the people who are making movies nowadays. If this seems more like a rant instead of a review, that's because it is one."
16 April 2021,Starts differently but ends in the typical Marvel franchise blandness,6.0,"Well, as I'm not a fan of the fomulaic Marvel universe that often tends to copy itself over and over again, I thought I'd give this a shot as some reviewers praised the intitial suspense of this series.

And well, it seems to be no surprise that while die-hard Marvel fans don't like the beginning but state that the series gains traction at the middle, for me it is vice-versa. I found the first episodes quite nice, as they introduce some fresh ideas (from the changing titles to the ""sitcom"" aesthetics). Unfortunately the series quickly deterioates to the typical trite Marvel plot where in the end the protagonists fight with cheesy-looking CGI power beams and it's all about superheroes flying, power-beaming and stereotypical evil corporation/military guys that we all know are no match for the good guys.

I've been glad when the credits from the final episode rolled. I'm not saying this series or the Marvel universe is bad per se, it's just not my taste and if you like the other Marvel stuff, you'll surely like this. Everyone else will probably find the first episodes entertaining and the rest unmemorable."
15 February 2021,Amazing,10.0,"For the many reviews i've seen giving the whole show a bad rating because of the first two episodes is ridiculous?!? This show builds up every episode. Although you may think it's lighthearted it is actually quite the opposite, very tense and creepy and close attention. Although the show has an already high rating, it would be even higher if people wouldn't have rated it based off the first two episodes!!! They're building on the story, not going to tell you it all in an episode!!!!"
24 December 2021,Watched it a bit too late,9.0,"I've known WandaVision ever since it came out, but because of various problems I couldn't watched it until now. To be honest it is a really great tv show. I mean it was new. It is very different from the typical tv shows I've watched."
11 February 2021,One star off for first three episodes,9.0,"But, I get it...well played... I haven't been this excited about upcoming episodes in a very long time."
29 January 2021,Wait and watch it gets better,9.0,"The first 3 episodes are a little slow buts it's the part of the plot they are trying to display, In episode 4 it gets very interesting and it's worth the wait"
16 January 2021,Off to a Medicare start for me...,7.0,I have been waiting for marvel to drop us something to watching mcu related since the terrible mistake of not releasing black widow on vod. As a comicbook from when you had to read the story and couldn't just watch I find this new show to be slightly boring to be honest (so far). I definitely understand what they are setting up and think I know what they are trying to do but I just wish the episodes were a little longer. I've never been a huge wanda/vision fan to be honest and that fact may sway my viewing experience a little. I have very high hopes for the next 7 weeks for sure and I know this will end up being a home run. Just give it time! If marvel can turn a lackluster movie like captain marvel into a blockbuster hit this 9 episode show should do very well!!
15 January 2021,Brilliant,10.0,"Brilliant, Beautiful, Amazing, comedy, suspenseful, entertaining Show."
5 March 2021,"Outstanding Marvel, outstanding",10.0,"Just finished watching all nine episodes and I have to say, this has been absolutely magnificent from start to finish. So original, so we'll acted from the main protagonists and antagonists. I've looked forward to Friday every week knowing that I'd get my fix from this show. I'll now have an itch to scratch this Friday, I hope Falcon and Winter Soldier is up to the scratch."
5 March 2021,Great and totally worth watching,10.0,"It was amazing for me. Didn't expect a miniseries to be so good. Great cast, background score, story and direction. Moreover, it's big budget and has got good production value. Felt like I was watching a 9 episode movie. Yes sometimes it feels stretched but the pros are much more than the cons. Waiting for the next MCU series."
9 March 2021,Scarlett Witch,7.0,"Confusing in the beginning, Exiting on the halfway, and disappointed by the ending, it's decent, good acting"
22 January 2021,Not the worst show but it's certainly in the running...,3.0,"I'm really at a loss these days. What's considered amazing cinematic excellence is escaping me. I get it I get it....wow what a craaaaaazy idea to do a 50s style sitcom thing that in ABSOLUTELY NO WAY WHATSOEVER adds to the story or even insinuates why on earth they'd allow these pretty damn good actors to act in a way that takes away from their actual abilities. Aaaaaaamazing 🙄 Remind you of anything? Where something good was seemingly purposely and utterly decimated by smashing it into a decade it should never have been in....? Wonder Woman 1984 for the win? Anyone..........anyone.....? Again.....I'll give it time and maybe another episode or two, but so far this is unwatchable. Period. It's hack. It's not interesting. Couldn't be less compelling if it tried. The writing, the acting, the directing, even the casting is abysmal. This show is the epitome of nowadays. Pointless, going nowhere, poorly thought out, terribly executed and god awfully boring. If you're on the fence on this one....stay on your property. Ugh this is bad."
21 January 2021,Low rating but its a very good show? WTF,10.0,"It is an amazing piece of art, it as so much more to unravel and people are not getting the idea. The mistery of what world wanda is creating, the message behind each episode, why is that happening and when will we know. They recreated in a very creative way the old movies and it has an original concept and idea of cinema growth. Can't wait to watch more. This is very artistic and different in every way possible."
10 February 2021,Great exploration of grief,10.0,
28 February 2021,Amazing,10.0,That is an amazing Tv show! It's one of the best things that marvel have ever made
15 January 2021,Meh,1.0,Not what I was expecting. I patiently waited for this to release and I must admit that I am disappointed. Episode one was great but episode two was a miss. I will not give up on the show after two episodes but I'm hoping episode 3 stands out. I love Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany so I hope the show does get better. The show is unique and weird but it's missing something. Something that will make it stand out from the rest of the tv shows out there. It has a lot of promise and potential. I expect it to be around for awhile if they can keep it interesting and not lose sight. I highly recommend you wait until all episodes are available because the first few may turn you off. Similar to The Mandalorian.
30 January 2021,By the 4th episode you get answers,10.0,"It's so good! I love this show. For those who think the I Love Lucy vibes stay forever, you are so wrong! Such a unique show. Love it."
13 February 2021,Review up to episode 6,9.0,"For those to rush and burn the show from episode 1 or 2 just stop watching. A new series needs time to evolve and you need time to understand what the show runners want to show you. Many say the first 3 episodes are bad because it's a 50s sitcom etc. Without those episodes the show cannot go deeply to where it needs to go. It's Wanda's world and she can do whatever she wants with it. Or it's not her world 100%. We don't know and that's the beauty of it. Was I impressed with the first episodes? Totally YES! Because it's Marvel (I am a DC fan in comics) and they know how to do it. I believed the show had a lot more to tell and keep us interested. This is what's happening right now. Every next episode i better than the previous one. Every next ending it hooks you up more than the previous. If you are reading this, stop reading reviews until you watch the whole thing. Trust the show and stick with it. Marvel offered us something totally new in Marvel terms and maybe shows in general. However it is not missing any cinematic experience, special effects or storyline. If I didn't start watching the show and knew a little bit better, i would have waited for all the episodes to be released and watch them all like one movie. In my opinion, this show is one usual high quality Marvel movie, cut in pieces with some modifications to work as a tv show. 9/10 is a fair rating for this considering the genre, experimentation for new things and overall quality."
16 January 2021,Extraordinary,9.0,"I think the people giving it 1/10 are missing the point. For something to be extraordinary, it needs a background of ordinary to shine. And this show does it perfectly. Using a copy of 'Bewitched' with hammy one liners, but combined with something far darker and at times chilling, the two episodes so far had me hungry for more."
6 December 2022,Strong start then boring same old super hero stuff,7.0,"The first few episodes start out funny and charming. Very much like asit-com with some amount of meta humor. I could have watched several seasons off that stuff.

Then the actual story unfolds and it all becomes all boring action-focused boringness. I guess if you are really into Marvel you'll find the second half exciting. If you aren't that much into Marvel and all its self-referential content, you might want to turn off after episode three outer four. All the charm gets sucked out of it by the standard Marvel stuff. Plots about other events in there Marvel universe, predictable fights, BLA huh blah."
15 January 2021,$150 million? Where did that money go?,7.0,"Marvel, this is a bizarre series - not in the sense of, ""oh wow, they did an interesting take and took these characters in a new direction."" No: It's more, ""what on Earth am I watching??""

This was not a good direction to take this. With characters as rich as Wanda and Vision, you could have literally done anything. These two brief episodes would have been a good idea if they were presented alongside the actual action-packed series, or released on youtube for PR reasons, but not the entire series.

Also, I remember producers (?) complaining about the limitations of the 25 million per episode budget. Ummm, where's the money? I just don't see it.

Shoutout to the supporting cast - they were all phenomenal - and I noticed Emma Caulfield, which was very cool to see.

*Overall rating changed based on the brilliant finale.*"
22 December 2021,This could have worked out,2.0,
20 February 2021,Mindblowing!!!,10.0,I am crazy about this series!! I love the fact that they are not afraid to go against everything we have ever seen before. I wont spoil anything but you gotta see this show 😍
11 March 2021,Great!,8.0,"Slow start for a Marvel production, but impossible to miss for fans and it is great! Lots of action and can be entertaining for anyone over 12, good watch, great acting from Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany. Lovely effects!"
20 February 2021,Brave and brilliant,9.0,WandaVision is so inventive and I think Marvel Studios and Disney+ have been brave in making something so different. The homage it pays to American sit coms over the years including adverts and credits is so clever. As the series progresses we get more and more clues as to the mystery behind Wandavison and it broadens out into such a treat for fans of the marvel universe. Elizabth Olsen and Paul Bettany put in strong performances with a great supporting cast. Well worth a watch.
19 March 2021,Exceeded expectations,10.0,"It was what its title said, a show of Wandavision no x men, mephisto or other characters irrelevant to the story. But a perfect story of the best couple in MCU. Truly emotional and epic. The only tv show that made me cry."
31 January 2021,"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast",10.0,"Listen, if you can't take 30 minutes to watch a black and white episode, then that's fine, don't want WV and don't wait for all 9 episodes. Just drop it now. But, when folks are talking about it left and right as more episodes come one, don't be an a**hat and jump on the bandwagon.

What is unfolding here is going to piece the whole past and future MCU together. For those that can't see that, I'm sorry. But this is GREAT"
27 September 2023,Not so strong showing from Wanda and Vision,4.0,"In my opinion, the first episodes were not interesting at all, or at least they could have been more interesting, at least it would have turned into a situational comedy, it would have been better.

But little by little, the series got a little better, but it was still not very satisfying.

The main problem of the series was not the original story, but the script and story line, in addition to showing different decades and coming to the future, it could be better than this.

Considering the character and powers of Wanda and Vision, a much better and more exciting series could have been made.

The way Agnes entered and the way she failed was very lackluster.

I think that this series was created only to harmonize with the film (Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) in the Marvel universe, and it seems that the creators had no other goal.

Many of the actors in this series played very artificially, in general we can accept this series, but compared to the characters in the series, it was not really a good series, just a simple entertainment."
14 February 2021,Best Marvel Show so Far!,10.0,"Definitely, the best marvel tv show yet! The characters & connectivity to the MCU movies makes it an awesome watch for MCU fans."
18 March 2021,absolutely one of the worst things ever produced.,1.0,"Do not believe that it gets better after the 4th episode. It does not. This kind of trash television should never be watched or produced. Poor writing, no coherent story, awful paper thin characters."
15 January 2021,Seriously,5.0,"I've been using IMDB for 7 years now & this is the first time I felt the need to write a review. After waiting 1 and a half years for new MCU material, this is what they give us? I'm a huge Marvel fan but this is a joke.

The worst part is the episode length. The two episodes say they're 30 & 37 minutes, but that's not accounting for the fact that they have 10 minutes worth of credits on both. At least when you watch shows on Netflix, the runtime is the actually runtime.

Overall huge disappointment. After you keep people waiting for so long for new content, you should be embarrassed to put this out. I came here for an action show not a 60's sitcom"
4 April 2021,Boring,1.0,"Waste of time, bad jokes, waste of money and characters, unbelievable."
21 February 2021,A mash-up of different types of genre,6.0,
21 June 2021,"WOW ,JUST WOW!!!",8.0,
23 January 2021,Wanda's vision,1.0,
8 June 2022,Good,6.0,As a fan of Wanda I'thought this show was fantastic It perfectly shows how powerful Wanda really is And it makes her a complex Character Watch this before you watch doctor strange it perfectly sets up doctor strange Highly recommended.
3 March 2021,Amazing show!,8.0,The storyline gets intense gradually. Acting and dialogue writing is impressive. I highly recommend it.
20 January 2021,Not coming back,2.0,"I watched the first episode and part of the second episode. I will not be coming back for more. Once again Disney takes something good and ruins it. I so wanted another show to watch, but I didn't get laughs or excitement out of this spoof."
3 February 2021,Different But Not For Everyone.,9.0,"Wandavision is a mix of rom-com, fantasy, mystery and maybe a bit of thriller. It's message is dark and it shows us that something is wrong with Wanda mentally without telling us. It really expresses mental illness in a fun and twisted way, if you look really deep into it. The show is very different, not lots of people will like the whole 50's theme and the romantic comedy part and that's okay. I recommend that you try it out because I promise that it isn't just a fun rom-com , it has an interesting twist around episode 4. My only problem with the series is that it's kind of slow paced, other than that I recommend. Just stick around !"
7 May 2021,Genuine Disappointment,,"Even as a huge Marvel fan, this mess was too poorly written to enjoy. Starts uniquely insane but never pays off. Everything is a place holder with no impact setting up a payoff that never happens. We are left looking to a future Dr. Strange movie for answers Disney + is turning out to be a money grab waste of time. It seems all they care about is virtue signaling as they nab subscribers using the good will and greatness of the MCU past."
16 November 2021,Not Bad !,7.0,"As someone who did not love wanda's character from the previous movies, I was not sure to start this series but I started it anyway.

The series is not bad and some episodes was really good and overall I can say that I enjoyed it.

The problem for me is that the events are a little bit boring."
6 March 2021,"Good Story, with Twists",4.0,
5 March 2021,Just don't know what to say. #SubvertedExpectations,4.0,"Stuff happens is the only thing I can tell you about this show.

Episodes 1-3: Mediocre at best (4/10) Episodes 4-8: A step up, but still ok (7/10) Episode 9: But why? Why would you do that? Why would you do any of that? (4/10)

Goes on for too long. Could've easily summed it up in 4 episodes max.

MCU's attempt at a new direction where their content isn't formulaic is halfhearted and average. They wanted to produce a mini series which continues on to Doctor Strange 2, but here's the problem with mini series, you have to wrap up the entire story within a particular frame so that no loose ends are left and the ending can feel satisfying. But this doesn't do that and instead opts for relying on its previous movies as tropes and several, SEVERAL questions are left unanswered which doesn't make the story sensible.

While one could argue that these loose ends will be tied in upcoming movies, what about the structure of mini series? Where's the damn payoff? 9 weeks all for absolutely nothing.

And remember I said that MCU tried making something that isn't formulaic? Well, the last episode pretty much destroys that reputation. I don't have much to say about that.

Again, Random does not equal to good. I'd recommend that the average joe skip out on this series because it does not get more boring then this. Do not follow this clout because it's going to disappoint you.

And as for the MCU fan, well take a look at the 10 star reviews...."
15 January 2021,I can tell I'm gonna love this show,10.0,"Yes its very different but its only 2 episodes and I'm looking forward to where its gonna go. No need to give it a 1 or a 10 as we haven't a clue whats gonna happen in this show and people saying they're gonna give this show a pass need to stop being stupid its just 2 episodes out of 9 you haven't even gave it a chance, wait till the whole season is out then make your mind up."
15 January 2021,Had a grand nap to it...,1.0,"Sat through the first episode and was not impressed. I started to watch the second, to give it a chance, and had a very nice nap and woke up as the credits rolled. Great for a nap but it's a bit meh"
5 March 2021,WandaVision series finale.,9.0,"Well the first run of WandaVision ended. I won't spoil anything, but the ending was anticlimactic. While I enjoyed the series as a whole, there were issues that made it amazing on one hand but frustrating on the other. Elizabeth Olsen is incredible as Wanda, as always. Paul Bettany is also great as Vision. These roles seem to fit them very well and they nail them every time. The costumes upgraded a bit and I really liked the new looks. I was hoping for more of a ""reveal"" as far as the ""who"" and the ""why"". They addressed them but again, they were a bit anticlimactic. Each episode did advance the stories and added Easter eggs that brought more confusion to the series, but was also cool as well. While the Mandalorian was for me a more enjoyable series, ESPECIALLY the ending, this was fun but didn't end with a BANG!"
7 February 2021,great show,10.0,This show is the best superhero show that I ever seen it its wonderfull
7 March 2021,The whole performance is literally outstanding,10.0,"As a person who has watched all of the MCU movies throughout the years, I was pleased with how they presented the show as a whole. The storyline is impeccable and it fits right between Infinity War and after Endgame perfectly. WandaVision Finale , my whole perspective of it changed and even if you find an episode boring , it is still very important in the build up to the amazing climax. You need to have faith in this show and keep watching it because the plot twists keep coming and every single character in the show evolves amazingly. it was incredible its sad to know its only one season but i hope we see more of her story in Dr Strange or any other marvel movies even her own movie. The cast's incredible performances amplified the brilliance of the script, as they truly embodied a person from that period, right down to the mannerisms and catchphrases. lot twists keep coming , character development keeps changing , and the whole performance is literally outstanding."
6 March 2021,"Great concept, mediocre execution",7.0,
17 February 2021,one of the worst tv show i ever seen,2.0,
28 June 2021,wanda and i,8.0,"Honestly, watched this series i feel like i watch my self. Wanda is literally me that makes another world (in my mind) so that I feel happy, even though it's all fake. She wakes me up."
19 January 2021,F-U-N,,It is a funny show that swiches the the action to comedy and it givs it a mistery
15 January 2021,"No this show is not bad or crap, you're the problem.",9.0,"You're the casual normie who's only used to watching fast and furious movies with no plot and has never seen anything classic at all. So please, learn some cinema history first before you start review bombing this."
15 January 2021,Couldn't watch til the end of episode 1,3.0,"Using a TV format, that outlived itself for a reason is a decision that is beyond me. It was not funny but annoying with all the laughter in the back. Hoped for something good but was disappointed. I am a marvel fan, I find most movies masterpieces or close to it. This I hope is not the beginning of mediocre marvel productions to capitalise the excellent marvel reputation."
6 February 2021,MARVEL IS BACK!!!,10.0,"I have always been a fan of the mcu and I've waited fot wanda vision for sooo long. I was unsure it will be a successful mcu series at first but after the 3rd episode, i changed my mind, even tho the first 2 episodes are considered boring it is about wanda & vis's life in westview, which is necessary, before we know what's actually going on. The 4th & 5th episode are amazing. It feels like the ""mcu"" i've always loved :,) i'm so excited for the next episode. I'll send more reviews soon! xx"
25 January 2021,Fun to watch...awfully irritating laugh/awww track.,8.0,"Having grown up on 1950s and 1960s sitcoms, I find this quite the humorous throwback. It is fun to see and hear the truly obvious cliches...but my enjoyment is reduced considerably by the horrendously fake laughter and other machine-generated audience reactions. Sickly. I wish they would remove the laugh track entirely, but maybe it's supposed to be part of the vibe. Bleh."
15 February 2022,Overall series Vision back to front!,7.0,"WandaVision is a show that will lose a lot of it's audience because it takes too long to explain to the casual viewer what exactly is going on, as if they had used the first episode to explain what was generally happening in the Marvel Universe them more people would stick around & watch this whole series to the end ( which it deserves as overall series 1 is 7 stars ).

In all TV shows Series 1 Episode 1 ( is the important episode to catch the attention of as many viewers as possible, as some people will be more casual viewers in which case this first episode must catch the whole attention of all the audience & offer something for all to enjoy & want to see more of, however here is the failing of WandaVision as it only appeals to Marvel Universe fans in the first few episodes & by the time it really gets going it already has lost a lot of viewers ).

Though WandaVision starts off slow by the middle of the series things start to make sense & then the series starts to come together & starts to really become a bit more interesting, though overall it is still just 7 out of 10 as like most of these Marvel TV series some times the scripts become ridiculous & convenient to put over some characters in a better light than they should be.

That being said the main characters Wanda & Vision do a very good job with the script given to them, but the supporting cast is only average TV quality which is a shame though as the script is often very average for the supporting cast I guess only having 2 star actors work for this series ( as hopefully Wanda & Vision will return in future made movies if appropriate that is )."
6 March 2021,WANDAFUL!!,8.0,"The series started off kind of weird and zany, but she was mourning for her loss. She was going through a processes of healing and when challenged by the powerful Agatha Harkness, she evolved, and became The Scarlet Witch!!"
15 January 2021,Is this an out of season april foolsjoke?,1.0,They have to be trolling us? This is garbage. I made good food to watch this. I want my 55 min back!

23 February 2021,Episode times are not enough..,8.0,"Such an incredible try. I really love the thought. But (a big BUT) Too short to wait. Marvel had to give us long episodes (at least each 45 min.) for explaining the case in detail or episodes should have been released at the same time like netflix. Otherwise, time! does matter..."
1 March 2021,Chaotic Dark and Ghastly,10.0,
5 March 2021,Pointless and stupid,3.0,"These superhero movies are not about hero's, they are about gods. Stupid, boring and overly dramatic gods. Fighting silly epic battles with predictable back and forth. Do the people giving these movies favourable reviews read? Have they ever studied the elements of story telling?"
5 August 2022,Could be better,8.0,
15 January 2021,The begining of Phase 4.,7.0,
23 January 2021,Not really a review just a random comment...,8.0,"I seriously can't believe Vision caught the piece of fruit falling off the table and actually said ""I can't wait to be a proud 'papa-ya' ""

I really like the show so far but if they're trying for ""cringe-esque"" comedy with lines like that... then they've definitely succeeded lol

...""proud papa-ya"" while catching a papaya falling off the table; WOW... just WOW! I legit wonder if the writers just thought of jokes that they would've used from back in the time period they're ""currently in"" on the show (which is probably the late 50's or early 60's) or if they just used the weirdest or cringiest joke they could think of? At least not ALL of the humor is that bad. The show does truly have some clever and funny jokes in it too. I just wanted to point out the ""proud papa-ya"" joke bc that one just hit me in ALL the wrong ways haha"
1 February 2021,"Creative, Authentic, Fresh and Exciting",8.0,"The MCU is experimenting with new ways of storytelling. Now don't get me wrong; I love big, crazy and flashy action sequences as much as the next guy, but it can get repetitive, and even boring, if overdone in every. single. film.

WandaVision is a breath of Fresh air. Creative, Authentic, Fresh and captivatingly intriguing. It'll leave you curious, theorizing and anticipating Fridays. It doesn't give you too much each episode. Just a little hint at what's coming next, a mere glimpse, to work with each week, keeping you enticed. Well-executed.

Elizabeth Olsen is brilliant, her versatility and range as an Actress is wonderful to explore. Playing a character that was so dark, edgy and mysterious to such an accurate depiction of a Happy American Rom-Com wife. It's a full turn-around.

This show is genuinely pleasant. It's a cute idea to show how two Supernatural-ability- beings can blend in with normal people. It just, works. Reminds me of The Incredibles.

I enjoy the characters from previous MCU films, and the subtle and small elements of horror and thrilling sequences. They didn't overdo the Creepiness, it would lose its flavor, and I appreciate that.

it doesn't cater to fans of the MCU who aren't fully invested. You must know the background of these characters, their timeline, and their arcs to understand it.

I really do enjoy this show, and I can't wait to keep watching. I find myself re-watching the episodes when waiting for the next, really love Agnes's character.

Now my complaints being, the End-Credits are really quite too long, although skippable. I was disappointed to see how short the episodes were when you remove 7 Minutes of End-Credits. I'm alright with the Parody-Mockery type of Cheesy humor, but the show really is quite too slow at times, I find myself bored. And I would've appreciated all the show in one serving, to binge. But, I understand why Marvel chose not to.

I recommend it."
13 March 2021,Love this show. I hope the actors get awards.,10.0,The actors are very darn good. Elizabeth and Paul are fantastic. Kathryn isn't bad either. I would be so upset if no one wins an award for this show.
16 March 2021,Fantasic miniseries,10.0,"As a big fan of the marvel universe I'm of coursed a little colored by this, but I believe fan or not, you will love this show! With everything from the humor, to drama and amazing buildup to the last episode. Without a doubt in the absolute top of all the films and series in the universe, so far!"
18 January 2021,Wasting Our Time,1.0,
6 March 2021,"Brilliant, imaginative & new.",10.0,"Integrated, connected, coherent and continues the MCU. Hints of amalgamation yet to come. Wow!!! What a series!!! A twist to the initial delivery and a twist in the the final credits. Open mouthed, shock moments followed by tears. Giving a titanic romance the finale it deserves where End Game failed. For MCU fans... this is an absolute MUST!"
27 February 2021,Twisted,9.0,
26 June 2021,I love her,9.0,"Elizabeth Olsen, than you for Old Boy. Thank you thank you!!!! Ignore negative reviews. She doesn't do bad movies. I'm not some psycho obsessed fan of hers either. I'm just a fan. Doesn't mean I have to love every movie she's in tho. I just happen to. At least ones I've wanted to see. And the ones I've wanted to see, never disappoint. And it's not like I'm only a fan of her. I'm a fan of a lot of good actors, guys & gals. Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Scarlett Johansson etc. Could go on for days. Plenty of movies I don't like with those actors but for most part, I usually will like em cuz they great actors who chose those movies for a reason.

Just ignore the negative reviews. Some people are just negative. Should always ignore 1-2rankjngs period cuz they are clearly trolls, haters, bias reviewers or something. Then take the rest of reviews and go from there. It def gets better the deeper you go into it too."
15 January 2021,"Wow, this is bad!",1.0,"Two episodes in and I'm done. It's boring, not funny (despite the annoying canned laughter), and I've never known a 22 minute show have a 7 minute credit sequence before.

Maybe it'll get better, but I won't be sticking around to find out."
17 August 2022,I've Watched The Whole Show,3.0,"The show is boring. The premise is actually pretty great and this is an integral part of the whole Avengers theme but it's executed with a terrible script. The whole idea could have been done with more. Also this show has plot holes, DEEP ones.

The first plot hole is about the whole witch stuff the 2nd one is silver part that I ain't gonna spoil. The third part is where the VISION 2.0 went to? Big questions to get answers to, but I have no idea where as of now.

Btw this is a series on how Wanda and Scarlet Witch collides. So yeah this series is a CANON for the whole Avengers universe and Scarlet Witch I'd say.

My suggestion is to skip 3-5 episodes, because the first few episodes will be re-shown and explained and doesn't give you any juicy details. Though this show is very bad in being the prelude of Scarlet Witch, just like a stretched out teaser.

The effects were great, the green-screen was bleh and the props/flying movement was hilarious. Anybody who's giving this a high rating is only rating from probably last few episodes where shirt hits the fan in an ""aaaaah at last"" kind of feeling when you can enjoy the juice of Marvel Universe.

TL;DR show is dull, full of holes and could have been done better with script writers who don't copy-paste from google. OVERRATED and extremely unfunny."
4 February 2021,Lol at those bad reviews not even 3 episodes in. Shame on you.,9.0,"It starts off slow but boy does it get good quick. So much linking to past MCU movies and so much mystery for the future of MCU and how this will tie-in to the multiverse. We are in for ride people, hold in cuz it's gonna be fantastic! Love it!"
23 January 2021,Love it,10.0,"I love the classic tv shows. So it's just perfect for me starting the way it did, I know it's going to start taking a turn but overall I love it. People who are complaining are lame lol"
17 January 2021,Can't wait what's next,8.0,Two episodes in and I just wanna say that I never appreciated enough Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany as actors. Their roles are perfect. Can't wait to see what this show is bringing to MCU phase four.
24 May 2021,This Show Introduced Me To Marvel,10.0,
28 March 2021,An incredible error or television,9.0,"I watch marvel religiously and I am down for every single little adventure to come in the future! This series is amazing, from the set design to the visual effects. I have never watched a show with so much mystery and speculation, I was questioning what would happen next every step of the way. Unfortunately all the speculations went a bit far and by the climax I think most of us were disappointed.

Either way it's a phenomenal show with my only criticism being it could have delivered a bit more at the climax. Although most of the plans they was going to do was cancelled due to the pandemic and instead on 9 it was originally meant to be 10 episodes long. So I can't really blame it. Either way an amazing show and I really enjoyed it through from start to finish."

30 December 2021,extremely disappointed,1.0,"I was not a fan of this series or the characters. The action was subpar, the lines were cheesy, the character interaction was surface level, and everything the audience had worked for alongside wanda felt all for naught."

7 March 2021,A Missed Opportunity,7.0,
16 January 2021,Pay attention to the small clues.,9.0,This show has a purpose. It's leading up to something big. Wanda and Vision can't remember anything from their past! Whenever things start to no seem pleasant things change quick. There's obviously something going on and we have to wait and see what it is. I loved the first 2 episodes. And stop saying it was an I love Lucy spoof. It was Dick Van Dyke! Learn you classic sitcoms!
7 March 2021,Great origin story,9.0,

15 January 2021,Disney reviews make the high ratings,1.0,"Its terrible i really wanted to like this show but its so bad dont waste your time. Believe the dislike for this show it is that bad.

Its funny how anything made by disney even the terrible still has good reviews."
1 February 2021,Truman show meets bewitched,5.0,"I thought that they come up with this story as a prank to test Paul Bettany and that Olson woman, but stange as it maybe it kind of works and gradually the cloak is lifted and the real story is coming out. This links directly to The Avengers films, not sure if its a prequel and this is her Wanda-vision of the future."
10 October 2021,Vision ... and vision!,8.0,"A totally unique plot. Wanda got Vision with her vision. Isn't it? I am astonished by the fact that how much effort Marvel gives to making those episodes totally similar to 70s or 80s sitcoms. Hats off!

Wanda Maximoff aka Elizabeth Olsen and Vision aka Paul Bettany! Wonderful acting! Their chemistry was so cool.

Though the first 3 episodes were kinda boring to me. I know it was a wonderful sitcom and I am aware of the fact that these 3 episodes were the main path of the series. But don't know, I'm not enjoying these first 3 episodes."
17 January 2021,Boring,4.0,"My brother stopped watching after 1st episode and went to the kitchen to watch youtube clips on his laptop instead. I seen 2 episodes, but think it's boring and annoying with the american style laughing tracks (like in Big bang theory)."
11 February 2021,Confusing but a worthy successor to endgame,10.0,
18 January 2021,Fantastic!,10.0,"Like a lot of people I would imagine, I was sceptical to say the least, however only after two episodes it's been excellent! Acting is first rate, the creativity very original and refreshing, and a story that keeps you guessing! Highly recommend!"
15 January 2021,Those who are expecting action straight away - STOP!,10.0,"I really loved it! The writing was clever and the directing was very good. It captured the 50/60s sitcom really well esp. the campy and tongue-in-cheek humor. There's a creepy feel in some parts which adds greatly to the mystery. Liz and Paul were both great and charming. Their chemistry is just so adorable. 💗 Kathryn Hahn was also amazing as Agnes.

It doesn't give too much yet (mostly those we've speculated from the trailers) but the little bits they added to tell us what's really happening was just enough to keep the intrigue flowing. I can't wait to watch the rest of the episodes!"
16 January 2021,A surprise to be sure but a welcome one,8.0,"Like a lot of people, I was really hyped for WandaVision but was a little skeptical as I did not know what to expect but I love Wanda and Vision, I love the MCU, I knew it was going to tie to Doctor Starnge 2 and I'm open to something new in the MCU and so far, so great.

Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are awesome in their roles. In fact, every actor is. They're clearly having so much fun and are are really entertaining and funny to watch and each actor has great dynamics and chemistry.

It's such an intriguing and creative premise as well. You have no idea what's going on but with the subtle hints the movie gets like when Mrs Hart comtinues saying 'stop' at the end of episode 1 and that radio call in episode 2. It just keeps me so intrigued and excited to see what's going on and I love how each episode seems to be set in a different decade and we also get to see Wands and Vision with their powers.

The humor hits really well most of the time but it's quite overdone and tries too hard I personally hate that stupid laugh and 7 minutes of credits bump it down but I cannot wait to see how the show continues and I have a feeling as the mystery gets unravelled, everything will become clearer so I cannot wait."
28 August 2021,An interesting concept,7.0,"This is a weird series for me; I actually started this series before Loki and F&WS but finished it last. The first 2 episodes, while interesting, didn't really pull me in as I didn't know where this story was going even with the episode teasers. It really wasn't till episode 4 that I found myself finally seeing the direction this series was going to take. This is definitely one of those slow burn kinda shows but once things get going they really get going. It becomes a more normal Marvel based property by episode 4 and frankly it was fun from that point on.

The big baddie reveal in episode 8 was terrific and the actress they hired to play her was brilliant. As I know very little of The Scarlet Witch lore; this did catch me off guard as I never read spoilers.

Did this really need to be 9 episodes? Probably not. Do I regret watching it? Definitely not. If you're a Marvel cinematic fan; this will be a must watch just to keep up with the whole universe as they always tie things together. I am looking forward to the next live action series with Hawkeye and perhaps the new Black Widow?. Till then I will watch MODOK and What If."
27 January 2021,Just Awful,5.0,Got to the 3rd episode and sadly it's not getting any better. There's probably about 2 minutes each episode that's worth watching.

We are truly in an age of television that goes above and beyond the normal Not just film stars taking tv roles but big screen films that want to tell a longer story than 2 1/2 hours so they're giving us a group of 9 episodes for freaks and geeks to pick over looking for Easter eggs or clues to the next big reveal Has a series ever had as many channels devoted to every frame on YouTube and it's not even finished"

16 January 2021,A storm is coming...,10.0,"People need to wait it out before bashing this show.

It was always supposed to start as a sitcom-like weird reality that Wanda has created for herself. Don't treat this show like your average MCU content.

This show is going to blow everybody's mind. Wait out the rest of the episodes and you will for sure get your old MCU-goodness with alot of mind blowing stuff coming your way."
24 January 2021,fails on every level,1.0,"Not sure what they are trying to do here. i watched 2 eps, its not much of a marvel show so far... its like an old sitcom but somehow made even more shallow. it sucks as a sitcom, it sucks as a marvel show"
15 January 2021,worth the wait,9.0,"I see negative reviews on here and i do not understand. this is fun, epic, and an interesting superhero show unlike anything seen before. the writing, music and sets really take me back to what sitcoms used to be. the writing and story makes me question what is happening and what will happen. Marvel entered phase 4 right. can't wait for the next episode."
12 September 2021,Waste of time,2.0,"Marvel did a great job to hire ""reviewers"" and score such a great rating here but in reality, it is such a boring, bad and dull attempt to be original.

Really, waste of time."
17 May 2021,Just watch it patiently,6.0,"This is an good show from marvel . Definitely you should watch for more magical marvel vibes .

Just watch it patiently because you may get bored in episode 1-3 but if you watch it patiently then I can say your time will not gonna waste ."
7 March 2021,"An inventive, daring dive into the great beyond of the post-Endgame MCU",10.0,'WandaVision' is a creative triumph of television which will excite you for the next phase. It's bonkers; it's emotional; it's the perfect proof that Kevin Feige and co. have more surprises up their sleeve yet. Go in with an open mind and enjoy the show!!
16 January 2021,One word review,1.0,Its pure TRASH . Watch it on your own risk if u have nothing better to do
15 January 2021,Short episodes and not much content either!,5.0,"Wanda and Vision are the two below average and most boring characters in MCU (movie universe) despite their massive powers. So my expectations, though not low, were not high (definitely not nearly as high as for Loki). Still, the two episodes managed to disappoint me for two reasons- very, very short episodes and very less content, nothing much happens in the whole two episodes. The only reason I will continue watching the series is the anticipation of some interesting and big things in the future since it's MCU and they likely have spent a ton of money on this. Hopefully it gets better, but based on the first two episodes, it's just 5/10 from me."
7 March 2021,Honest Review of Wandavision! So far so good.,8.0,"Hey IMDBers and non, welcome to honest reviews!

Wandavision is so far, a really good marvel series. I've seen a lot of people complain about how confusing it is, and I don't disagree, but I see no reason to get upset about it. It's a mystery series more than action and sci-fi. Therefore, it's supposed to be like that.

Okay I get it. It's much different than anything we've seen. But I just ask that all you Marvel fans give it a shot. I haven't watched the entire series, heck, I'm only on episode four, so the rest could be horrible. However, I have high hopes and expectations for the rest of the series.

If you're looking for a kid friendly yet slightly disturbing mystery show that slowly explains itself, watch it. The actors are great, the story is so far great, and the cinematography is done really well too. It's confusing, but it's worth it in the end.

Now, remember, if you're looking for a sci-fi with lots of action, classic bad guys and a simple storyline, this ones not for you. I still recommend you watch it if you're a Marvel fan, but if you aren't, I see no reason for you to watch it. If you're looking to get into Marvel, I would suggest you watch Captain America: The First Avenger first. It's got all that action that Wandavision doesn't really need.

So in conclusion, great show so far. Looking forward to the rest of the series and would recommend strongly for all Marvel fans. Confusing? Yes. Brilliant? Also yes. I'll see you next time, enjoy the show!"
6 March 2021,"Uhhh, no",3.0,
15 June 2021,Nothing happens on this show,3.0,"Long, drawn out gimmicky plotline. If all the episodes were joined together and cut down to a 2 hour runtime, you would get a 4/10 movie, so would not be much of an improvement. Just another miss by Marvel in a long string of misses that I am sure are yet to come. How the mighty have fallen, I fear Infinity War will remain as the last of the entertaining marvel projects."
1 July 2021,Started strong,6.0,"This show started with a creative premise, but quickly devolved into your typical superhero story with cheesy, unbelievable sci-fi tropes and banal fight sequences. Not worth watching past the first few episodes if you're not a fan of the superhero shtick."
16 October 2021,An absolute nonsense! Trash,1.0,"Don't even waste even a second on this. It is dreadful.

How do they get away with this trash!? Dreadful! Not worth a watch. People who rated this 8 out if 10 are literally barking...m."
17 January 2021,Clever and artfully done,10.0,"I wasn't sure how I feel about this approach at first but the more I explore it, the more impressed I am. There's just so much happening in the background here that you'll keep finding new tidbits to keep you hooked each time.

On the surface it feels like a tribute to classic sitcoms- Wanda and Vision are your regular suburban couple- he goes to a 9-5 job, she does chores and they both crack cheesy jokes while trying not to stand out too much from the rest of the neighbourhood. They go as far as shooting in front of a live audience, in black and white, using old reels and camera tricks instead of CGI. It's impressive really. If I didn't already know, it would be very hard for me to tell that this was filmed last year and not in the 60s.

But don't be fooled by the cheery facade. Because underneath it all something really dark is going on. There are hints throughout and you can just tell something is horribly wrong and Wanda is not ok. It's only a matter of time till this entire act unravels and all hell breaks lose.

Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bethany get a chance to showcase their versatility as actors and they don't disappoint. The direction, cinematography, make up and set design are well done too. A+ for commitment! I was not expecting this from Marvel but I sure as hell appreciate it!"
20 June 2021,Brilliant,10.0,"Give this a chance. This is a beautiful portrayal of love and hope, grief and trauma. Elizabeth Olsen portrays Wanda so heartbreakingly that it is easy to understand her reasons for doing what she does. I absolutely loved this series. It was emotional!"
16 January 2022,A masterpiece,10.0,"The first couple of episodes were a bit confusing. But after watching the whole series: it makes sense, and it's amazing.

Elizabeth Olsen has always been underused in the MCU movies, and I'm so glad she had her solo project. We really needed to see more of her character and how complex she is. WandaVision gave us the informations we needed in the post-endgame era about Vision and Wanda Maximoff.

The writing is very good. And I wasn't for a Marvel project to deal with grief and depression like that. It's very refreshing.

This series deserve a 10/10 because of its originality, because how unusual for a superhero series to be this way. And it's a very good introduction to ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness""

WandaVision has a high rewatch value. Be careful, you might end up like me and watch it 4 times.

If you're a sitcom fan, and a marvel fan - this show is for you. It's fun to try to spot sitcoms references that once filled our childhood.

Also, you might see some familiar faces in this series..."
6 March 2021,Strong start terrible ending.,6.0,
17 February 2021,Just Awesome,10.0,When you will see this series after 3rd episode You can't wait for next episode.. Series will be better and better ..
15 January 2021,Incredibly Boring,1.0,What a waste $25 Million Dollars A episode don't know where that money went. It was such a disappointment I honestly don't know what the hell the producer's were thinking the story is basically non existent and has nothing to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe other than Having The Scarlett Whitch and Vision in name only. Wish I could give this 0 stars.
26 March 2021,Good start to Marvel Tv.,8.0,Wandavision is an amazing start to the MCU getting its first show on Disney plus. Each episode was different from anything I've saw any show do before. The sense of wonder why watching it wondering if this is real or fake kept me on the edge of my seat each episode. Can't wait to see more from Marvel with Disney plus.
10 February 2021,"Turns out that you actually need a brain, in order to appreciate cerebral stuff... Who knew.",10.0,"Those who talk smack, are the same people that always jump to the second half of Civil War. I'll just wait to see how stupid you're gonna feel, when we are going to have all of the episodes edited together. As for hurt WB fanboys, you better go obsess over a videogame-looking director's cut, complicated is not for you."
15 January 2021,Wandavision is Disaster,1.0,I saw the first two episodes and they sucked. This is degrading all the previous good work that we know off in MCU.
27 February 2021,Awesome doesn't even begin to describe,10.0,"Slow first 2-3 episodes due to the back story buildup(the reason why the overall rating is not at least a 9.2/10), but I hung on knowing Marvel studios couldn't disappoint........and they didn't. Elizabeth Olsen legit deserves an Emmy nomination for her acting. Simply legendary, if you're seeing this and haven't seen WandaVision, start now!"
20 January 2021,OMG,1.0,"What utter drivel. I dint wan't write anymore than that but apparently my review was to short so in addition, How desperate were the actors ?"
15 January 2021,Jumped the Shark,2.0,MCU have really jumped the shark with this pile of trash. I can't believe Paul Bettany agreed to film this.
16 February 2021,Obsessed!,10.0,"It's the highlight of my week when we get a new WandaVision episode! This is next level television, nothing short of that Disney magic. Elizabeth Olsen is fantastic in her role as Wanda Maximoff, her face never fails to say a thousand words. She's the star of the show! Also I must praise Kathryn Hahn for her performance. 10/10 can't recommend enough."
16 April 2021,Loved it!!,10.0,Best marvel series so far Expecting more series like this.
29 August 2023,if only it was independent,4.0,
29 January 2021,Ep 4 is freaking Awesome!,10.0,
18 March 2021,Very captivating and totally worth the time,7.0,The first 5 episodes were very captivating and I totally loved the cliffhangers My hopes were totally raised while watching the series but the finale would just leave you in disappointment
27 July 2021,Very painful slow start but gets better,6.0,"If you've watched all of the Live Action Marvel Movies released by Disney of course you will find yourself watching WandaVision. Who doesn't want to find out what the aftermath of one of the Avengers after End Game. The simple fact that this show is Canon to the Marvel Cinematic Universe will compel you to watch it.

Getting through the beginning of this series was rough. The first three episodes do not feel like a Marvel Movie but rather you are forced to go through sitcom like episodes of the past that are similar to the programming of old Nick at Night cable channel.

You can definitely see the Disney influence in the campy nature of the show. Fortunately once you get past the first three episodes the show picks up steam and you'll start to enjoy the show again as we find out what is actually going on.

The final episodes are the highlight of the show but you have to go through some cringe worthy episodes before you get their."
4 March 2021,Exceptional show,10.0,"You can tell the plot of this show has been thought out very thoroughly from the first two episodes being released at once, to the reveal in episode 7. I personally enjoyed the first to episodes but understand that they were slow, it is not fair to rate a series on the first 2 episodes out of 9! In all, an excellent show!"
15 January 2021,I want my 44 minutes back,1.0,Watched the first two episodes and all I want is that time back. I have no idea what the people behind this series want to do but they failed miserably
3 March 2021,Innovative and yet just pure pure pop culture,10.0,"It is so refreshing to watch a blockbuster show actually daring something completely off and yet be just purely entertaining. While it may not fully speak to a younger audience, growing up with the Marvel Movie Franchise, it will certainly resonate with an older generation of movie buffs and/or TV audience that actually experienced how movie making or, more particularly TV shows, were done. All the while packing it into a new costume. And the result is worth watching. I am not a Marvel fan of any sorts, but I was hooked from the first moment. This is about creating something unique and new, not about satisfying the costumer. I am still surprised how they got the show done. Brave and innovative. As the plot unfolds, nothing new awaits, but how it is executed and portrayed is truly superb. This is both an hommage to filmmaking and innovative in the same way. They pulled it off. I gotta applaud that by giving it a full 10"
16 January 2021,Shameful exploitation. Don't waste your time on this.,1.0,"For biased fans, please don't just rate 10 just because you want it to have a high rating. Be honest with yourself. Is this what you really consider a 10? If I'm generous, I'd give it a 4.5 and I really wanted to like it. ! It doesn't really help the show to get better and the producers won't seek to improve it.

This show is supposed to be a Comedy in which I finished 2 episodes so much as a smile. I waited and waited. Please watch the show and then give your honest opinion.

I gave it a chance and if I'm 100% honest, this is extremely lame. Maybe it was aimed at the Disney children's crowd, even then it falls short."
22 January 2021,Confused But Intrigued,8.0,"The weird parts in the show are mildly interesting, but there are a lot of boring parts as well. I genuinely was confused after watching the first episode. Watching the second helped the show gain my interest, but I don't understand the overall goal of the show or where it fits in the timeline. Paul Bettany is the only reason some of the jokes land, but I do believe the show is trying too hard to be comedic. All the scenes with women are a bit weird and many seem overacted. I only hope as time goes on the show becomes less confusing."
19 February 2021,Dragging,2.0,This is like watching a boring movie that takes forever to get to the plot. Disappointed that I had to wait for this(pandemic). This is supposed to be about super heroes. I'm not interested in their mental health issues unless there is tons of action and so far action has been at a minimum. That'll teach me to expect action in such a genre . Hopefully falcon & winter soldier will have more action and less about feelings
23 January 2021,Overrated so far,7.0,"First 2 episodes was weak boring and weird. I get it, its the Jetsons, I dream of Jeanie, bewitched, the honeymooners and a few other throwbacks wrapped into one. I thought something anything would happen and nothing. I'll give it 1 more episode then deuces."
25 January 2021,Mockery not funny,4.0,"First 2 episodes were new not interesting. Mocking early television is an interesting way to get viewers but not my money. 3rd episode i was asleep 10 mins in to it.

Thanks but i will skip future nonsense."
3 March 2021,Zero stars,1.0,"Doesn't seem to have any clear plot or direction. Just all over the map. May as well watch ""I dream of Jeannie"""
16 May 2021,Amazing Marvel Series!!,9.0,"To be honest, the overall series was amazing. None of the marvel movies or series made me laugh this much. It is a great series filled with action, comedy and romance. It was good to see old characters like Darcy and Monica.

If you are a Marvel fan, a must watch series."
28 March 2021,A must watch for MCU fans.,10.0,
5 March 2021,A great feat for Marvel Studios,8.0,"Here I am writing this review exactly an hour after finishing WandaVision. I have to say that Marvel knows how to play the game. Every aspect of this series is well developed as well as the acting by Paul Bettany and our Scarlet Witch Elizabeth Olsen is brilliant. I guess, this is only the beginning and there are many more mystical subjects yet to come in the future. I am rating this series 8/10 because I feel that they had wasted an opportunity which you, the viewers will come to know after finishing off the finale. Keep it up!"
11 October 2022,Intriguing,8.0,
6 March 2021,Slightly above average,6.0,"The story is a good one, as most Marvel stories are. This is no different, but there are a few kinks in how they told the story. The first three episodes were pretty boring. Very little action and a lot of references to things that most people, even huge fans, would have no clue about. There were a few neat surprises, which I won't spoil here. Episodes 4-8 were great. However, the ending fell kind of flat due to some lame reveals and a lack of promised cameos. In the end, most fans will appreciate it, but it will leave you feeling somewhat underwhelmed."
2 March 2021,"Love Wanda Vision, small spoiler, very small",9.0,
26 February 2021,Have you watched previously on MCU?,6.0,"To begin my review I must say that I'm no comic books fan so I don't follow MCU movies (dropped since the second Thor because I was only 21 then and I have overgrown these brainless movies). I believe all of them comic books adaptations to be shallow, superficial, plain dumb and I base my opinion upon everything I've heard and every little homework I had to do while watching WandaVision but more on that later.

When I've seen the first glimpse of this show I was surprised: it showed me some black-and-white old style sitcoms in the vein of I love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke show and Bewitched so I naturally was pumped because I love old Hollywood and I absolutely adore those shows. So I decided to give this show a go, what the heck, I've nothing to lose. But what I had to lose was too much time on it.

The first three episodes were very good right up until the ""real life"" started interfering. I didn't understand all those Easter eggs and references so I had to watch some guys on YouTube explaining me every little detail, telling me their little theories about this and that, what they think will eventually happen, who is the real villain, who killed whom to get what... After some point I realized I could not enjoy the show without doing this homework after every episode because the more I watched the more answers I needed (I guess everyone did) but the way those guys (I don't want to call them nerds - professional comic book fans should sound better) were so eager of each episode coming out and how they translated to me that this character is from this comic and how the MCU universe expanded with the addition of Fox to Disney and what heroes have doubles in parallel universes and how is it possible to die and be reborn and then not die or WHO CARES! I don't watch the show or a movie, any show or movie, for the purpose of researching it first so I can make heads and tails out of everything - it's not what a good quality picture should offer. I guess people from the cinema industry are so sold on the idea of making sequels, reboots and remakes so they forgot most of the original ideas, there are still plenty of those, but are not used for some reason. Do you guys think people are so dumb they want to watch a neverending TV show? Santa Barbara days are gone, deal with it!

The main problem is the audience of WandaVision. It's for MCU fans only. They will not get the references to the classic TV shows, mostly, but all the rest they will eat with skin and give it the highest praise possible (and I see it happened already with a total score of 8.3 as of Feb. 27th). All the rest of the viewers will just be confused as I am and after a certain episode (in my case, 8th) they will stop watching because the further the mystery unravels the more you lose the grip of it because you hadn't paid attention to ""Previously on Avengers. NEVERendgame"".

Don't get me wrong, the show is made beautifully, the script is fine (every little detail is noted and everything has its place - as the professional comic book fans kindly explained to me), acting is very good but not great, effects are outstanding and why should it be otherwise? It's Disney and they will not make a bad job. They even tried and paid homage to the old classic shows which adds some extra points to my review but overall I just don't see how it can be interesting to any non-MCU fan. No one starts watching the show from season 6 or reading the book from chapter 12 but WandaVision is exactly that season 6 and chapter 12. The saddest fact though that after episode 4 the show becomes less and less about Wanda and Vision and more about some other characters and that all in the end is supposed to build up for some upcoming movie from the franchise. I don't want to spend my time watching endless movies about endless characters that seem to never fully die anyway."
16 January 2021,Can you give less than a star ??,1.0,What a shame. It's an embarrassment to the great universe we have come to love
16 January 2021,Average entertainment,5.0,Plain and simple. Its the Truman show mixed with the twilight zone. In my opinion the sitcom angle might lead to another mcu villain from the Xmen universe which Wanda is also a part of. Mojo just a guess. But if you didn't care for these characters before the show. Dont waste time its average and not interesting.
19 January 2021,Only saw first two episodes,10.0,I love the risk taking. I love where we are and excited to see where we are going. Not for everyone. Butttttt for me!
5 March 2021,"Now if I don't give a perfect 10, then when shall I?",10.0,"I am crying now. Just watched the season finale. Quite different from what I expected to see. But, personally, it's just perfect to me. Oh Scarlet Witch, you're my new found love...."
11 March 2021,Agents of Shield Level,6.0,"I get it that this may be aimed at a younger by Disney audience, but I found it to be just meh. Agents of Shield was more interesting. The vintage stuff will probably just be weird for kids, such that they will get bored. This goes on far too long in order to stretch out the series. And, the intrigue, when it finally starts, just doesn't hook you in as a Marvel fan or anyone else. I won't be back for another season. If Falcon and Winter Soldiers doesn't step it up, I'm done with Disney."
17 January 2021,One the best creation made by Marvel,10.0,
26 January 2021,So boring,1.0,Three episodes in and nothing of substance has happened. I will hold off watching the next episodes to see if the reviews state that the show has finally turned the page from it's goofy 1960s sitcom but I am not at all confident that it can be saved at this point.
7 June 2021,"Disappointing Second Half, But Great Start!",7.0,"Watch this series for its homage to Hollywood iconic series. It is interesting with plenty of laughs.

Sadly the laughs ends when the main plot starts, which honestly is nothing great. Even the revelations feel boring and you just hope for it to end."
31 January 2021,A bridge to the next phase?,9.0,"This show's development reminds me of how 'Agents of Shield' progressed from somewhat boring and clichéd to adventurous and creative. Episode four is the point, I hope, where this one takes off. Yes, there have been tiny glimpses of what lies beneath the cheesy sit-com surface and none more so than the closing sequence of episode one but now the cat is almost out of the bag.

Being unsure of the direction it will take, I am pondering if this is being used as a bridge to the next phase of the MCU and the introduction of new and less familiar characters. We shall see.

The production values are good, the visuals are what we have come to expect from the Marvel studios and the humorous touches are subtle, not over done. I have high hopes and will keep on watching.

Irrespective of the reviewer comments, opinions are subjective and I think the whole thing needs to be seen to really form a conclusive review. Mine may change but for now, I am enjoying it."
15 January 2021,So boring,1.0,"Not worth anyone's time. Nothing interesting about it, just plain boring."

8 May 2021,"Unique, solid series.",9.0,"Loved this series! I think this was a great first entry into TV for Marvel Studios. Unique and different from their past movies. The incorporation of the sitcom aspect was a brilliant idea in my opinion. It worked well for the show and the actors. The cast was really able to shine as a result. Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Kathryn Hahn, and Teyonah Parris all excelled in their roles and nailed the multiple decades of sitcom acting. Great performances. My only real critique was the ending of the series, specifically the last episode. They didn't fully stick the landing there. Several characters like Monica didn't really get their due as I feel they were set up to and supposed to. But overall it was an enjoyable series and ai would 100% recommend it to anyone questioning whether to watch or not."
31 January 2021,PERFECT!,10.0,"As the story moves on, it gets more exciting . character art is so good."
5 February 2021,Get past the first 3,8.0,Get past the bizarre first 3 episodes (they are intentionally bizarre) and you will be rewarded in ep 4 and 5! And the show pulls it all together brilliantly if you turned off after the first couple then you really should pick the show back up.
3 June 2021,I dont know who rate this show so highly it gets 8. it's 5-6 at most,5.0,"The 1st 3 episodes is too long and boring, shouldve cut it to just 2 episode.

Most of my friends drop watching it on 3rd episode I tell em to continue because it does get better on ep4 onwards.

Afterwards the unveiling of main villain and finale is good.

But the ending is meh. You know kinda the end you wrote when you was a kid on your english essay some story and ends it with ""suddenly he/she/they woke up and it all were just a bad dream!"" ending.

Ugh.."
5 March 2021,Underwhelming,1.0,"Underwhelming with a lot of build up and no pay off. Really disappointed with the end, similar to a game of thrones experience."
23 January 2021,One of Marvel's most Ambitious Projects,10.0,"What people seem to not understand about Wandavision is that it's supposed to be corny and is supposed to mirror sitcoms from the 50s - 90s. Each episode is from a different era such as the 50s or the 60s or the 70s. The show is great at providing enough mystery and weirdness to keep viewers watching. Casual Marvel fans will bash this show for being ""too weird"" or ""slow and boring"" but as each episode progresses the more the plot thickens. This show is phenomenal and I would definitely recommend it."

A lot of tease but not a satisfying end, but seen the track record of marvel they could surprise us i had faith that after quicksilver they will introduce Xmen but no i thought after seeing all the magic and spells they will bring dr strange but no."

19 January 2021,Well well well......,1.0,"I looked forward to being entertained by some well written screen play with a quality cast.

But .......I soon realised episode 1 was not funny, not clever , not entertaining or even hooked in anyway. But hope was held onto that episode 2 would be better....but I was left thinking that I had been in a time machine and missed the 80's, 90's ,oo's etc.....it's probably the worst mcu I have seen. I feel for the cast as I'm sure they have been contracted before they read the script to do this. So sorry ! It's so so poor . It's not clever at all. Anyone that thinks it is please stop taking the ketamine"

JUST because the first idea sounds great, doesn't mean it is. It's like someone watched Pleasantville then came up with this. Pleasantville was phenomenal. This just feels like content for the sake of content.

I lost whatever respect I had for the Marvel universe AND even the concept of superheroes.

Elizabeth and Paul are fantastic. And the production values are phenomenal. But this idea is asking too much suspension of disbelief.

How many other ideas were rejected for original content before they decided on this?"
16 June 2021,A for originalty,8.0,Format is really confusing at times but liked Wanda's living in a sitcom thing including fake commercials and catchy songs for each season was a nice weird fun touch.hope they come back and give them a good ending.
6 February 2021,Pietro!!!!,9.0,
20 November 2021,The neverending story,8.0,Enjoyable until the last episode. The Marvel universe is just getting long in the tooth and they need to give us new eyeball food and not just the same BS special effects CGI punch out flying around fight scene.
8 June 2021,Hats off to the writer!!!!,9.0,
20 March 2021,It's underwhelming,7.0,"WandaVision feels like what a marvel film shouldn't be. It's not a bad thing and I would like to see more Marvel projects like this but I can't help but feel like this one didn't stick the landing very well. The first 3 episodes were okay and the next 4 were good, but it felt like the last two episodes were a major disappointment and the build up that was implied in the episodes before made it feel like a fart in the wind. On a technical standpoint, everything was spot on, like the cinematography which is by far one of if not the best in the MCU. It was a good series which could have definitely been better but it's definitely a good stepping stone for phase 4"
7 March 2021,Boring !,7.0,"First 3 and last 6,7 very slow ... Pointless episodes .., just bad comics at tv. Good acting but no justification of any character .. Definition of superhero is changing .. u just have to have powers and then you ultimately will be justified in whatever way the show wants...."
21 March 2021,Stands out from the others,8.0,The first 2 episodes are very slow but the tension starts to build up from there and it turns in to a really exciting show
22 May 2021,"Come on, it deserves a 10!",10.0,"I've seen everything marvel, and the movies again in chronological order... I'm not a huge fan boy but I I've found the whole thing entertaining. Not amazing just entertaining. Now wandavision is something else. It's very different to what everyone is used to, and for the better. MCU is at this point so predictable, the movies have lost any spark that phase one brought. I'll go as far as to say this show is the best outing of any MCU effort."
18 January 2021,Enter the MCU Multiverse,10.0,A refreshing experience after so long without any MCU. A hint of Sci-Fi with a dash of Mysticism and sprinkle of true love Romance. This show begins with 2 Easter Egg filled episodes that are sure to deliver a major plot twist payoff. MCU Phase 4 officially has begun. Let's get Weird.
7 March 2021,Marvel did it again. Marvel blew our minds away with another amazing show.,10.0,"This is the best superhero show. This show is full of surprises, thrill, suspense, comedy. Kat Dennings as Darcy and Randall Park as Jimmy is a treat for the eyes. They are the funniest part of the show. Kathryn Hann as Agnes is perfect. Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen, both are so cute together. After the mind-blowing end credit scene, I am very excited for Dr. Strange in the multiverse of madness."
23 January 2021,Too much filler not enough plot!,4.0,Seeing as each episode is around 35mins long I'm finding there is 25 mins of useless banter coupled with that terrible canned laughter track with only about a maximum of maybe 10mins of actual plot per episode! Having said that when the plot actually does happen to enfold I find it mysterious and entertaining. I hope the writers decide to make the episode more about the actual plot than the terrible wannabe sitcom fluff that takes up most of the show as is the case three episodes in?
20 January 2021,Only 2 episodes in but why should I care.,3.0,"I am sure there will be a huge pay off at the end but it isn't holding my interest now so why bother, I like that its different but like a new haircut, without a personality its just a haircut."
16 May 2021,Brilliant!,10.0,"This serie is something special. It's not your regular Marvel content. The first couple of episodes is guessing and theorising and from there it's just a treat from start to finish. The acting is incredible. The writing is terrific and the characters are beautifully and well written.

For all superhero fans, this is a must see!"
15 January 2021,So incredibly disappointing,1.0,"I have never written a review before but all of these positive reviews have forced my hand. The first 2 episodes were dull, forced, boring, and unoriginal. This show would bomb and fail and fail and bomb if it didn't have MCU backing. I don't understand the 8.5/10 rating overall. It was supposed to be a comedy I'm assuming but I didn't even crack a smile."
16 June 2021,"Great beginning and middle, good end",9.0,
18 February 2021,We tuned out and turned it off.,1.0,"My wife and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen already, so we knew this was going to be painful. We watched the first two episodes, and want that hour back. We don't go for that ""it gets better"" because it should've been great right from the start (which also applies to everything in life)."
15 January 2021,A CHANGE IN SUPERHERO UNIVERSE THAT WE DON'T EXPECT,10.0,"Yes Only 2 episodes released today , so why some people hate this show so much or say this is boring. We should wait till the last episode to judge this sitcom. And I still don't know why marvel/Disney are releasing 1 episodes per week (this is not MANDALORIAN or something like that) but this all things is not in our control. So we all can wait for the next episodes."
19 June 2021,Loved this show a lot😘😜,10.0,"This is the most cliff hanging marvel show yet🎥🎥... Awesome story, starting was a real bummer and meant for boomers.... But its so amazing👍👍👍👍. Thank u marvel for this show."
29 January 2021,Watch the show,10.0,"Anyone under the age of 25 will probably have a very difficult time appreciating this show. It's a mix of Marvel, X-Files, and the Brady Bunch. It's one of the better concepts that Marvel has came up with. Well done!"
4 April 2021,Truely amazing,8.0,Incredible acting all around that really makes for an immersive experience. One minute you feel like you're watching a sit com the BOOM back to marvel action.
19 January 2021,Deadhead,,"Delighted I wateched the first 30 seconds of this piece of tripe, saved me having to watch the rest of the tripe, whatever the length is. I have no more comment to make, it won't make no difference. I love how college education is so fantastic."
5 March 2021,!!Excellent,8.0,"This show was different from all the MCU movies, at first I had my doubts, but this show kept proving itself episode by episode. I would've given it a 9/10 but the ending was a cliffhanger, I mean I've had enough cliffhanger throughout the whole show.... So I thought the ending should've given me more closure but it's fine.. The show is great, enjoyable and I recommend it for anyone who didn't watch it... Cuz it's really awesome and has a great idea with GOOD plot holes. And yeah, that's all."
27 February 2021,Great expectations,4.0,"Highly detailed and carefully executed tv series. Unfortunately doesn't take any risks, jokes&humor is off. Basically, there's almost no story. This is a well-engineered disney sandwich. Not on the same level with big screen Marvel in terms of story telling."
30 March 2021,Wow!,10.0,Totally over the top but so well done. Didn't think I was going to like it but it got better and better. It ws so creative and some great performances.
21 January 2022,Enjoyable,8.0,"It's refreshing to have something different, although I felt the first two episodes dragged the gimmick on a bit too long.

The chemistry between the Wanda and Vision was great, you can see why they got the first TV series.

At the end of it all, my biggest surprise was Russia having DVD box sets over 20 years ago."
16 January 2021,I love this show!,10.0,"This show is amazing. I'm never going to look at these characters the same again when watching them in an MCU film. I love seeing them in these old style sitcom situations, and the mystery behind it all. So unique, which is what the MCU needs right now. A good change of pace from the cookie cutter stories we've gotten used to."
2 September 2021,Wandavision,10.0,
14 February 2021,Wandavision episode 1-6,9.0,The first two episodes are basically a sitcom. Some people would get turned off after that but the next few episodes are very Good. I recommend you watch it.
15 January 2021,Horrible. Not funny. Worst Marvel show ever created.,1.0,"After reading mixed reviews I decided to watch with an open mind. Ive been a long time marvel fan for 30 plus years, but this show was a complete letdown. This show was not funny at all, the satire is poorly written and it feels like a cheap rip off of ""I love Lucy"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie""."
3 July 2021,Really fun & Different,8.0,Each episode got better and better revealing a little more each week. Very interesting. Love wandas acting. The vision was great too. Glad these guys got to spread their wings. Good job!
9 February 2021,Wow... Double WOW....this is class in a glass.,9.0,"First three episodes drew you in. You are watching American TV nostalgia. It's entertaining, it plods along, but, just as you are thinking, ""what the heck am I watching"" you are made aware that something is not right in this weird ""safe"" reality. Then comes episode four. I can't say anymore. Fantastic. Marvel, Disney, I stand and applaud you."
16 January 2021,Fell asleep watching,1.0,Sorry but this is boring as hell. It has to honor shows like I love Lucy and Bewitched with a bit of Pleasentville. Sadly it is more of an insult instead of a honor thing. Also funny to see that most 8+ star ratings came even before the release date.
2 April 2021,Great Start Okay Finish,7.0,Wanda Vision is pretty good. The sitcom aspects were fun and seeing all the weird things happening and their affects unfold was interesting. The show didn't finish particularly strong in my opinion. The last episode was pretty good but the two before it weren't very good. I would definitely recommend watching it.
7 February 2021,A marvellous show with compelling storytelling and complex characters.,10.0,"WandaVision is a marvellous debut into television for the MCU to develop its characters in much more meaningful ways and add complexity to the storytelling all the while expanding the universe into new and uncharted territories. WandaVision is surprisingly skilful in emulating sitcoms over the decades and setting up the tragedy we are about to witness later in the season. The show is elevated with another layer of mystery Including who is really pulling the strings? and how this facade is about to be torn down?. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are a blast, with Olsen particularly stands out with one of her career-best performances. To those impatient viewers, I would suggest that to stop watching the show weekly and binge the entire season when all the episodes are out."
20 February 2021,Boring,3.0,"Just boring, I figured it would get better as it goes but it hasn't"
14 March 2021,An amazing MCU TV show! Watch for mid and post credit scenes too!,9.0,"As a big fan of the MCU, this show was pretty awesome! Granted, the only other TV show I really liked was Agents of SHIELD which tied into some of the MCU films, but this show tops it all! Also recommend that you set time to watch at least the first 4 episodes in one sitting (Plus its right now all available on Disney+), as the first 2 are a bit slow paced and might tend to a bit boring, and ideally it starts making sense only towards the end of episodes 3 and 4."
15 January 2021,Marvel tried the Twilight Zone,7.0,"I was skeptical to hear that Marvel was making shows. I enjoyed Agents of Shield, but they failed to really impact the storyline of the MCU. That being said, WandaVision so far has been pretty fascinating. It's a nice spin on the classic sitcom, with the first two episodes in a ""We Love Lucy"" type black and white family show. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are a fantastic duo and a perfect cast to the show. It's will be really interesting how the creators will be able to create more personality to otherwise side characters for most of their time on screen by themselves or together. By far the best part are the commercials. They remind me of a Black Mirror or Twilight Zone episode. I'm really excited to see what they do next, and how this combines into Spider-Man and Doctor Strange."
10 May 2021,Gotta love the Marvel Universe,8.0,Started out a bit confusing and I lost interest a bit but the last 5 episodes cha he'd everything. Really well done and leads into a great finish. Hope for season 2 as some loose ends but really love Olsen and Bettany is brilliant. Didn't think I would like this but it really grew on me and was glad I stuck it out.
16 January 2021,Not what I was expecting,1.0,"Possibly due to not being from the US, I just didn't get the show at all. There's a reason why these types of shows don't exist any more and didn't take off in the UK. I love Marvel, but this is just dull. I get why Marvel wanted to do something a bit different, but I just wasnt expecting it to be like this. May as well just have done a re-run of any of shows that were around 60 years or more ago"
20 February 2021,Expect the unexpected,10.0,The weird writing makes this show unique but not epic.
5 March 2021,This is what I want from marvel,8.0,"After the superb finale that was endgame a lot of us were worried about what was to come next. Were there anymore stories to tell?

Yes. Yes there are.

After Covid gave us no new marvel content for over a year and black widow kept being delayed the future of the mcu didn't look good. But then marvel released this gem on Disney plus.

Wanda vision is a simple story of a woman in mourning and surrounds it with an intricately layered mystery with a loving homage to sitcoms at its center. Disney decided to make the genius move to release episodes one week at a time, keeping the mystery intact and leaving tons of room for speculation.

Wandavision certainly isn't for everyone. It's quirky eccentric and more than a little corny sometimes and I don't blame anyone for not being into it. But for me at least, it shows a plethora of opportunities for the mcu to move forward. I'm glad that marvel has made this bold choice and I'm glad their choice has been rewarded.

I can't wait for falcon and the winter soldier, black widow, Loki, and spider man 3. I'm sure they won't disappoint."
19 March 2021,Why is wandavision so great,10.0,
15 January 2021,Purdy good,8.0,"(Only first two episodes)

I can see why some people say it's boring, but these first two episodes aren't gonna immediately hop into the action. These episodes are meant to be like older shows, but cheesier. I know the second one was modeled after bewitched. Ig we'll see what happens next week. Very intriguing show tho."
29 May 2021,A Classic from Marvel Studios,10.0,A terrific series from the acclaimed Marvel Studios! Don't miss it!
25 January 2021,"Not very Funny, First 2 episodes, 3rd better. 4 onwards Brilliant !!! STAY WITH IT. !!!!",9.0,"Only just managed to get through the first 2 episodes, JUST !!. I didn't find them funny or engaging, just silly, hated the small screen black and white look of the fifties, I no that is what they are trying to achieve but I am not a fan, especially when you have spent several thousand pounds on a large screen tv, it just failed to hold my attention. I gave the first 2 episodes 1 star each and the third 2 stars hence the score of 4 stars. I will give one more episode a try as the third did improve towards the end but it must improve in leaps and bounds if it is to get me to watch anymore after that, just very disappointed as I expected much much better from Marvel Studios, well even they can have a flop I suppose.

Paragraph above was my review after 3 episodes.

From the 4th episode it's brilliant, love it, just stay with it.. All making sense. I think Disney should have realest the first 4 episodes together, then everyone would have got it. Hope there's another series to follow.

JUST STICK WITH IT FOLKS !!!!!!!!!!"
19 January 2021,A Strange Departure from Standard MCU but Well Worth It,8.0,"WandaVision is possibly, to date, the strangest entry into the MCU....and this is also the same MCU that gave us a gun-totting raccoon and a sentient tree. So far only 2 episodes have premiered and therefore not much is known about how exactly this connects back to the MCU films or how it continues following the events of the Avengers: Endgame. I have my hunches, but I'll keep them to myself for now. What I can say is that WandaVision appears to be a homage to the TV sitcom era of the 1960s and 70s. If you've ever watched the various syndicated shows on Nick at Night's roster (Bewitched, I Dream of Genie, Gilligan's Island, etc....), you'll find something completely relatable here as it hearkens to the golden age to TV Americana.

From the first moment of the first episode, it's not particularly clear what's going on. Wanda and Vision appear to be living in an idealized American suburb surrounded by friendly neighbors. Vision isn't hiding his identity as an Android but has the ability to change his appearance from the red-faced robotic superhero you saw in Avengers to a more normal looking man (Paul Bettany without make-up and prosthetics). However for those who are closely tuned in to the MCU, the series is giving plenty of clues and easter eggs about where it might be headed. What I can say is that this is a very refreshing change from your standard superhero action/adventures. It delves into the weirder part of Marvel Comics' lore but if you stick with it, I can assure you, that the pay off will be worth it."
18 January 2021,Finally Something New,10.0,The first two episodes were fantastic. The show was not only entertaining but gave me nostalgic vibes of the black and white shows my parents used to put on for me. The show was funny and left me feeling happy the rest of the night. Can't wait to see what they do next.
3 February 2021,Keep going!,8.0,"Don't base your opinion on the first two episodes alone, it definitely kicks off after them. Wish the episodes were longer!"
12 May 2021,A good show,10.0,"A great show. It was fun, thrilling and above all well written."
12 February 2021,An unexpected twist,9.0,I was a bit skeptical till the end of 1st episode but damn did they do a full 180 on the surprise. I am one of the guy who thought after endgame marvel wont have much to offer but boy was I wrong. KEVIN FEIGE just made sure that marvel is going anywhere anytime soon. Looking forward to all the future episodes!
15 January 2021,Not internationally appealing,1.0,I am confused who this is targeted for so far. It is probably made for an American audience as I cannot relate to this style and humor at all. Hope it is gonna get better as the show gets more colorful
21 March 2021,This show was great until it wasn't...,7.0,
22 February 2021,"Great show, great action",10.0,"When the first two episodes of the show released on Disney+, they started kinda slow, not very exciting and almost no tension. When I watched the first two or three episodes I thought that the formula was a lot of sitcom and one or two exciting moments, but is wasn't! Since episode three or four it become really Marvel like. There is not a character that I dislike. Conclusion: this show has humor, action, tension and cool and exciting characters! Already excited for the Falcon and the Winter Soldier!"
18 March 2021,Is WandaVision mainstream?,8.0,
1 February 2021,Fantastic,10.0,"It's about time they made these guys a TV show.WandaVision is a masterpiece, each episode makes you want to watch more."
6 February 2021,One of the best and unique,10.0,Good work from mcu.quality content i love the way universe expanding.beautiful stuff!
3 March 2021,Good referral from Marvel,8.0,"I enjoyed watching shaving and was excited for the ninth episode Good subtlety, good regular intent, almost predictable events, and excellent effects Thanks Marvel"
19 February 2021,A complete boring mess,5.0,"I don't get why people are so excited about this. The show is a complete mess, fragmented, poorly delivered story and carries no likeable elements like say GotG did when it came out as a curveball. Wanda and Vision are both great characters but this just destroys them."
18 January 2021,Ignore the 7.whatever rating,5.0,"After 2 episodes it's a 5. Period. Too early to judge fairly, but I judge it anyway.

It's I love Lucy with Wanda and Vision from Disney's Marvel's Avengers. If that does it for you, have fun.

I think it's corny and dumb."
28 March 2021,This is all because of Thanos!!,10.0,
19 January 2021,Huh?,1.0,This may be the dumbest thing I have ever watched. The characters have changed and become dumb down versions of themselves. The script is terrible. It's leave it to beaver with vision and wanda. They still use the same format and jokes from Leave it to Beaver. Except they don't work on 2021.
18 January 2021,it's worst,1.0,There's no response for this worst series no story behind this just they are their that's why they are their nothing to watch marvel now making worst series
24 April 2021,TOO good a series,10.0,Till episode 3 it felt something new but less fun such as a sitcom but after that they just picked it up and blew the roof.
2 September 2021,"Terrible, WORST MARVEL EVER",1.0,This show is terrible. Skip the first 3/4 episodes and it might just be bearable for you to watch. Olsen voice is really annoying as Wanda. Vision is the only good thing in it Save yourself 9x 30-40mins episodes and DON'T WATCH IT.
16 February 2021,The Best Series Ever,7.0,"This is the best series I have ever watched. Amazing story, great actors and fantastic set. This is something the MCU has never done before and that makes it so unique. I love everything about this series, full stop."
15 January 2021,holy hell what a s***show,1.0,Anyone who rates this is paid by disney bigtime could'nt bare to watch this even in fast forward
21 April 2022,Tell a good story and stop wasting time setting up all the sequels.,6.0,"There was so much to appreciate about the Marvel comics miniseries WandaVision...and then there were some things to really dislike, like the setting up of other movies and series that (here is a tip:thanks to the lack of focus on telling a good story) I am never going to watch.

WandaVision starts out imitating sitcoms of bygone eras, which was a fun and interesting twist on the origin story of one of their superheroes, who I figured out early on was grieving the loss of a loved one without watching any other Marvel shows. I liked that idea conceptually and thought it was fun, I even appreciated the darkness behind it all.

I really liked the character of Darcy Lewis, she was snarky, fun and well acted. I also thought the neighbor Agnes was a fantastic character...loved the hair and the can-do attitude!

In the end there were some loose ends and shameless preparation for additional shows that left a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel like the story wasn't finished. Hence...spend more time on telling a good story and your audience will beg you for more.

It was different and short, those would be the two selling points to use in recommending this but there are very few people I would recommend it to...maybe those who are Marvel-maniacs?"
15 January 2021,Disappointed,1.0,Not what I expected. Two superheroes living in a whole different era and it's in black and white. I get the creative idea but I want action not some old comedy like Bewitched. I hope it will change but for now I'm disappointed and not what I thought the show was going to be.
17 February 2021,A Masterpiece,10.0,"This show is nothing like you've seen before. Literally, the combination of both ""old genre"" and current era is so fascinating which keep you on your toes. For the Marvel fans, this is a rewarding show which no doubt everyone will love. Just sit, relax and enjoy this no-something-simmilar-before Tv Show."
7 January 2022,Simply AMAZ jk AWFUL,1.0,I would give it 0 if i can but sadly these bought reviews will keep it above 1. UNfunny UNintelligent and just simply not worthy of a marvel movie/show.
7 March 2021,Marvellous,10.0,"At first i thought that why is it a black and white comedy sitcom which they are showing but after episode 4 everything goes according to the Marvel standards, just love it and highly recommended for those who are into MCU"
27 July 2021,Incredible,10.0,"I feel in love with this couple. I felt Wanda's pain and her courage.

I really loved the series.. Love from Wisconsin."
22 January 2021,If I wanted to watch I dream of Jeannie...,1.0,Each episode so far is 99% nonsense sitcom garbage with 1% intrigue. 3 episodes in and I'm still uninterested in anything they're saying or doing.
15 December 2021,My all time favorite show,10.0,"This show was an experience to watch. It was so fun to watch and I couldn't watch the next episode soon enough. Being a HUGE marvel fan, it was so fun to see what they would do next. Marvel has never really done anything like this and it was so cool to see where they were going to take this show. Even the energy around the show with everyone watching it and coming up with all these theories that we thought would happen. Each episode catches your attention and didn't give it back. The acting was phenomenal and definitely worth the 22 awards it has won. The visuals were also stunning, as usual for marvel project. The way that they added to the plot in every episode and then revealed it all in the last two episodes was so easy to follow and you never expected what happened. The finale leaves you on a bit of a cliff hanger. It explains most of what happened very well but it still left you wondering, what is she going to do know? And some other questions about the future of Wanda and Vision. This show will always be in my top 5 favorite shows, it is so good in every way."
13 February 2021,Unexpected,10.0,"It's not what I expected but, it's everything I needed."
19 January 2021,Woke wet dream.,,"We have it in the Schools, the films, the adverts. It's like living in North Korea these days. Please try and make some content that doesn't force a view or it becomes tedious very quick."
29 March 2023,I found the middle part of the show to be the best part.,6.0,"This show was way too boring at the start. The three first episodes was too much. There is a mystery there that is interesting and got me curious, but they could have cut down on the sitcom a bit. Maybe if the sitcom was one and a half episode or something like that. The sitcom was not even that funny. Just boring and tedious. Some say that you just have to wait, that it builds up to something great. In my opinion, a show is not that good if a third of it is as boring as this was. It's possible to do much better and more interesting build up than this.

I found the middle part of the show to be the best part. It started to get really interesting, and the story got good and emotional. The cast is great with good acting, especially Elizabeth Olsen, she is fantastic.

It then fell short on the last episode. I did not like the final battle that much.

I'll give this a 6/10, just because of the middle part."
5 March 2021,Typical MCU show! Worth watching.,10.0,"A top-notch roller coaster ride with plenty of emotion, love, action & magic! So many questions unanswered but in the end of the day, what a masterpiece it has been! Don't overhype yourself with theories! Just enjoy the show & don't miss the post-credits! A perfect beginning of phase 4! Marvel, thanks for choosing me to be your fan!"
20 February 2021,Waste of time,1.0,"I have up after watching 5 min... It could be it gets better, but so far I haven't had the energy to waste my time with this show..."
29 January 2021,Better experience from marvel,10.0,"It's really good show, but some toxic fans reduced its rating."
25 March 2021,Meh,5.0,Didn't like the first few episodes but persevered. By the last episode I still didn't like it. I didn't care about any of the characters and some things were just too cheesy/not natural. Had high hopes for this as I like a lot of the Marvel stuff but this was just Meh!
15 January 2021,Very Hopeful and will watch it all regardless.,5.0,
15 February 2021,Fall in love 💕💕😘,9.0,
5 March 2021,MCU' most original but still MCU,5.0,
15 January 2021,"Unexpected, but wonderful show",10.0,"After one year since I've saw 'Spider-Man: Far From Home', the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally come back!

In the heart of classic television, 'WandaVision' is, without a doubt, an amazing superhero show with a mixture of comedy, drama, and science fiction from Marvel Studios.

The show is set after the events of 'Avengers: Endgame' where Wanda Maximoff and Vision begin to realize that everything is not what it seems.

The casting, such as Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, is wonderfully talented; the visual effects are mesmerizing; the setting is terrific; and the cinematography is amazing.

'WandaVision' is indeed an amazing superhero show to watch on Disney+!"
13 July 2021,Last episodes drag it down a bit,5.0,
29 September 2021,Disney really paying for those 10/10 reviews,1.0,Title says it all. This show is garbage. There's no way this show deserves an average 8/10 rating. I'm assuming some angry woke activists purposely tried to drive the score up or Disney is really paying to flood it with 10/10.
16 January 2021,Wonderful,9.0,"It depends on your sense of humor, but as a dude in his 20s I was laughing the whole time and I hate shows like Friends. It's that absurd, bizarre mix of MCU and 50s sitcoms with wonderful performances that makes it the most daring and entertaining Marvel piece I've seen since Infinity War.

I can't wait to see where this goes. If you're looking for action, go rewatch Endgame -- if youre can looking for something fresh and original with a hint of sci-fi and mystery, watch this. I'm having a blast."
15 January 2021,Great time to take a nap,2.0,"22 plus minutes of show. 5 to 6 minutes of credits. Though to be fair, I'll give it one more shot then decide whether to continue to watch it or use it as a great way to take a nap. Yawn......"
10 February 2021,Sitcom ?,6.0,"I wanted to watch a marvel series not a sitcom. The first episodes are just annoying and a waste of time.

Yes it's clear that there is something behind all of this and people are amazed what it turns out to be , but you have to get thru all of this annoying and unfunny sitcom Stuff."
15 January 2021,Not entertaining,1.0,Not funny few easter eggs bht other than that needs other films and spoliers to amke it intresting feels like a tv show to slowly realse spoilers for other films
29 January 2021,Good,10.0,"Show is good.

I recommend to any marvel fan.

Wish it was longer.

Need more.

More episodes.

More time with character building.

More world building.

Over all though this is a 10/10 so far."
6 March 2021,see you once again!,9.0,
6 March 2021,Skeptical at first. Hooked the next minute,10.0,"I was very skeptical to watch this show at the beginning because I felt like Marvel is best for movies. And bringing Wanda and vision into a series didn't sit right with me. But as time went eventually I got the hang of the show and it hooked me even more to know what's going to happen in the next episode and it just got better and better and better and I loved it. It really made me think it was not just a show about anything random. One thing about marvel is that they never cease to not have a story behind every single piece of work they create and I love it and I am here for it.

To anyone who felt very skeptical to watch the show at the beginning I will tell you to watch the show it is amazing that's all I can say great storyline, starts out well, and I love it try it out."
15 January 2021,marvel done it again,10.0,
16 January 2021,Wtf is this?!,7.0,"Way to have me completely question your plans with Star Wars, Disnay! Of ALL the stories you could have greenlit, why would you feel motivated to tell this? I couldn't make it through the first episode. I kept waiting for there to be a breaking of the fourth wall or some way this was at all relevant to the MCU. If I wanted to watch Bewitched, I would!"
5 March 2021,Worth the watch,6.0,"Great show all in all. Some certain issues in the performances but nothing bad to ruin the show. Also for a tv show effects were decent enough to keep you attached. Give it a try, i don't think regret will be your first thought"
15 January 2021,Boring..,1.0,I'm a fan but this ain't it the trailer looked nice so imma try the rest of it
21 January 2021,Maybe I will rate higher after the finale,2.0,"But for the moment it doesn't deserve more than 1 star. If I wanted to watch a sitcom I would've played Married with children. ""Something new"" and ""great acting"" it's all I hear these days but ""new"" doesn't mean good. The show is dull and boring (for now) maybe later will be different and I am looking forward to it. And what's with the laughs? I understand that is a reality that Wanda created but I don't understand why they had to include this aspect. I will definitely watch the rest of the series because I like MCU but if they keep going like this for another 90% of the show it will be a disaster."
16 January 2021,ANAZING CANT WAIT FOR MORE,10.0,"They captured the whole era elements perfectly whilst also twisted it with modern marvel elements we're used to, can't wait for more!!!!"
31 January 2021,Xmen!!!!,10.0,
8 February 2021,Getting better every week!,9.0,"I have to admit, having seen the trailers for Wandavision, I was confused as hell as to how Wanda and Vision had somehow ended up in a 50's sitcom. Then having watched the first 2 episodes, I was thinking what on earth was going on? But as each layer is peeled away you can see how clever the writing is for WV and there are so many Easter Eggs per episode that have call backs to past events in the MCU, its just brilliant. Am so looking forward to the rest of the season (and hope there will be another). I hope eventually, like all the MCU films beforehand, there will be crossovers and nods to each series from other Marvel TV shows (as Falcon and the Winter Soldier starts straight after, with Loki coming later in the year).

I loved the last 10 years of MCU films, and after the long gap since the Endgame/Spiderman conclusion, these series are a fun continuation!"
16 April 2021,This show is amazing. One of the best things to come out of the MCU ever.,10.0,"This show, from start to finish, will not leave you bored. I know that the ending was not what people wanted, but it is still one of the best TV shows in the MCU."
5 March 2021,good one but missing something.,4.0,Shows story is good not perfect acting is really good casting is good not perfect but really important think that marvel should understand that they can't compete with Netflix marvel daredevil level shows they are perfect and mind blowing.
27 February 2021,"Great unique show .... it is great story telling, we need more shows like this.",10.0,"There is not much to say that hasn't already been said by others. This is one of the most unique shows I have ever seen; the concept, the visuals, the story telling, the acting, the surprises and let's not forget all the great hidden easter eggs in each episode. For those who do not like the show, I bet it's because you either A) do not understand the mythos of these characters from the comics B) Did not watch all MCU movies as to this show heavily builds on from C) lack of imagination D) you always have to have your nay sayers. Even if you have not seen all MCU movies and not too familIar with the comics, you can still greatly enjoy this shows creativity as long as you are open minded and stick with it. This is the type of show that each episode pays off from the previous. I loved Daredevil, Jessica Jones, etc, but there is no way you can compare those shows to this. This is such a smart show and every twist and turn is so thought out, every tie-in is perfectly outlined, even the call backs from prior Avengers movies is perfectly linked. Again, do not listen to the bad reviewers, look at the majority of the reviews and you will see it is a fantastic show. Sit back and enjoy WandaVision for what it is. Btw, all the sitcom episodes are actually genius, if you pay close attention, they capture the essence that those shows brought to families during those times. It was great to watch this show with my kids, so they can get a little history lessons on how great older shows were."
5 March 2021,Liked it and its a good show,6.0,This show is all about how Wanda becomes the Scarlett Witch and the ending story with Vision. Showed how Wanda is manupulating the reality and rewriting it.
15 February 2021,Slow build up was worth it,10.0,
15 January 2021,Horrible spin-off. Writers should be fired immediately.,3.0,"Episodes 1&2 - 🌠🌠🌠3/10 Regardless of where this story leads to begin this series with 2 haphazard episodes showcasing Wanda & Vision trapped in a 60's Television show for 2 episodes is beyond boring 😴 and Utterly Wack for lack of a better word. These episodes should be treated like gold and having throwaway episodes isn't Marvel's standard of excellence, especially when it comes to pilots. Will it get better? Well it can't get any worse🙃 I suspect the show will tick up from absolutely no action whatsoever in the first 2 episodes but what confidence can you have in writers who roll that garbage out for Disney to sign off on has me absolutely flabbergasted. Watch the first two wasted episodes for 30 min. A piece but don't expect a Mandalorian hit in the making."
4 February 2021,Spoiler ALERT: House of M,8.0,
31 January 2021,What happened here?!,3.0,
16 January 2021,Ok people!,9.0,Ok people this show just came out today and it's already getting negative reviews?? Give this show a chance! It will explain what's going on! If you don't like the show don't watch it! It's simple as that. I for one like the show so far and can't wait for these upcoming Fridays!
23 January 2021,Incredible and thrilling! Elizabeth Olsen's performance is incredible in the MCU. I'm on the edge of my seat.,10.0,I've watched the show since last week and I like it. I'm watching carefully and trying to figure out what's going to happen next. I like the bits of a sitcom sketch. Now I'm hooked up to the set and the tense is thrilling.
26 February 2021,god level after 2 episodes.,10.0,"I rated it 6 after seeing 2 episodes, now i have to increase my rating to 10. It's awesome man, see it."
30 January 2021,Bold and creative. A new era for Marvel?,9.0,"This show has something going for it that is, at least for for me, something that will keep the viewer coming back the next week: mysteriousness. This shows narrative style is nothing like ""The Avengers"" franchise it was based on. The style has changed a lot and I think that is a good thing. The Avengers franchise had enourmous amounts of potential to just really play around with the science fiction genre, but never really did so (maybe except for ""Doctor Strange""). But with Wandavision it's a different story - this is true sci-fi. Time, space, reality nothing is what you think it is. And finally we get to see the full scope of Wanda´s capabilities.

While watching this i got strong ""Legion"" vibes another Marvel show I enjoyed very much (expect for the latter seasons, but I'm not going to get into that). Marvel is doing something right here and that is thinking outside the box and doing something that might at first glance be comepletely non-sensical but gradually becomes, well less non-sensical."
24 April 2022,Watch it second time,9.0,"Probably the most creative premise marvel has ever done, while not everything is executed well, particularly towards the end of the series, along with some pacing issues that stick out on second viewing. But overall it's probably the best written marvel story in the mcu. I also highly recommend a second viewing if you didn't enjoy it the first time."
28 October 2022,Overhyped,5.0,"While I found the show passable it nowhere near met the expectations that were set out by articles and recommendations that were made to me. Elizabeth Olsen is very strong in her role and really the acting in general is quite good, but the story to me was quite generic. It's basically A Marvel-ized version of the Truman show. The ending was fairly well done and set the stage in a smooth way for Marvel to build from it. Despite the ending being fairly exciting I am still not convinced it was worth it to me to go through all the black and white episodes. If I was looking to watch an old sitcom I would just put in the Brady Bunch or Leave it to Beaver, so having this black and white sitcom act extend out as long as it did seemed excessive to me. The point was well understood much before they decided to wrap it up.

I suppose compared to some of the rather dull movies that Phase 4 offered up this wasn't that bad, but also not what I was hoping for."
15 January 2021,1/10 is 1 star too much,1.0,Watched the first episod and fast forwarded the second episode and saw that it still was this white-and-black bs. Will not watch more.
5 March 2021,Most unique thing by MCU,8.0,
29 January 2022,"Weird, but good?",8.0,
25 May 2021,Very complex plot & clever twists!,10.0,"I thought that this series was absolute genius! An extremely well written show with everything you could possibly want from entertaining TV! Drama, suspense, comedy, action, satire & fantasy. Each episode revealed more of the story, it was so cleverly done; what more could you want?! Well done Marvel! Take a bow :D."
15 January 2021,"A bit of ""I love Lucy"" and pinch of Marvel comics and what do you get? An Amazing show",10.0,"Ok the first 2 episodes are crazy, but let's start with the plots and detailing. Holy crap, it's actually feels like an oldie but goodie tv show, and best of all Kevin Feige said this was preformed in front of a live audience, that's perfect detail right there. Of course some of it was corny but tv back then was like that, so it's not all that bad. Plus can I mention that the whole vision and Wanda in love thing is very sweet. Even tho vision is an Android, Iron man said he's more then a super bot, he's evolving. To what exactly? Idk, but he is becoming more different than what he used to be after civil war.

I will say, this show is really amazing with the cgi and color changing and I can't wait for more in the near future."
16 January 2021,Wow this is pure garbage,1.0,I can't believe I've waited for that crap . Worst marvel ever . Disney are taking us for granted. If you read this and didn't like give it 1 star so they will feel it .it's the minimum thing to do .
17 April 2021,Marvel's only and best cit-con,10.0,
25 December 2021,Slow burn thar gets better,8.0,"Wandavision is Marvel's first outing into the streaming world (if you don't count the Netflix stuff) and they take a bold risk with their mysterious series built on sitcom homages throughout the decades that mostly pays off. The series is well made with impressive visuals and recreations of classic sitcom sets to painstaking detail, giving the show a unique flavour and look from other Marvel properties. It is also extremely well acted, especially by its two leads, which is accompanied by strong writing in regards to a character study for the two, often sidelined heroes, especially Wanda, serving as the series strength. Unfortunately the show suffers a lot due to the constraints of weekly released episodes, that are far too short to be completely satisfying and pacing is a glaring issue, and can often make the viewing experience feel sluggish with the seven day waits. The series starts slow, but gains traction towards the middle, peaking at episode 5 and 6, before falling into a formulaic and somewhat unsatisfying finale. Also re-watchability is not very strong here as there are not many details to be picked up upon a series binge that you wouldn't have noticed the first time around."
27 January 2021,"Admit it fanboys, this sucks",1.0,"Sure the show will probably evolve into something interesting but that doesn't mean we have to suffer trough multiple episodes of trash to get there. The only reason this show doesn't have a 2 star rating is because Marvel fanboys can't admit to themselves they hate it. Not everything marvel releases will be good, get over yourselves. and p.s., the avengers movies aren't great either, just mindless entertainment."
15 January 2021,Fresh! Clever! So Satisfying!,10.0,So I just watched episode 1&2 and I'm beyond excited for episode 3 I need more! The casts performance is just flawless I love the feel of the show it's so unlike anything we have experienced before. I can't wait for more. It can be hilarious one second and the next ominous and unsettling... just WOW marvel studios is doing amazing!
16 January 2021,Consider me deliciously baffled!,9.0,"Within the first 5 minutes there was one thought constantly in my head.

""What in the holy guacamoly am I watching???""

My vision (full pun intended) was baffling me but the more I thought that, the wider my smile became, because the fact is I was thoroughly enjoying being royally baffled.

This has ""multiverse"" written all over it, and with each passing minute I became more fascinated. Seeing two iconic Avengers in such a unique setting is definitely a prelude for what's to come. Consider me CHARMED! And I cannot wait to see where this leads us.

PS: the 1-star review bombers really need to get:



You're only embarrassing yourselves with your clueless drivel. Maybe you'd get more out of it if you didn't have the attention span of a goldfish and the IQ of a rock."
11 March 2021,Garbage,1.0,Re-watch agents of shield or anything marvel other than this. Waste of time
19 February 2021,It keeps on giving,10.0,"It keeps building up, the first few a bit more boring episodes were necessary to establish the premise of the show. Every episode surprises, adding a bit more each week! The twists and turns. This is how you make a unique television series in 2021."
15 January 2021,Wonderful starting,10.0,"I think this gonna mad us. Wonderful starting must watch, avoid bad reviews"
17 January 2021,Rubbish,1.0,Speechless! Tried many ways to describe my disappointment yet always deleting what I wrote. Basically avoid at all cost - waste of time.
9 February 2021,People Can't Appreciate The Small Parts of Marvel Anymorr,10.0,"Although the show may hype up in terms of superhero content in later episodes, do not dismiss the first 3. If you have any appreciation for television or simply the characters of Wanda or Vision, you'll love this show. It wasn't a mistake for Disney to only release the first 2 eps. This isn't going to be another Endgame and that's alright. We've gotten so accustomed to huge battle scenes and set pieces in the MCU we can't just appreciate character interaction, and that saddens me. Definitely give this a watch, you won't regret it."
15 February 2021,JUST WATCH!,10.0,"The first 3 episodes what built the hype and story of the series, without it, it would not feel the same. Its really worth waiting for every episode and every ending builds the hype."
27 February 2021,Best series of marvel comics,10.0,
24 December 2021,too strange for me,1.0,This mini-series is a complete mess. Very ambitious and perhaps also artistically valuable. But I was just bored to death. The first two episodes are in black & white sitcom style. The third is in color but still in sitcom style. The fourth episode is meant to be an explanatory episode with regards to the first three episodes but that did not work for me.
1 May 2022,"Great Concept , Booring Narration",4.0,"In First 4 Episodes They Portrayed as a Sitcom (Which Was Not Funny also ).

Added Some Supsense in Episode 4 But Still Some Unnecessary Scenes Dragged the series.

Totally Boring Narration.

Not Upto the Mark ."
30 January 2021,Unbelievable,10.0,First two episodes were like what was happening? Nothing understood. 3rd episode got slightly unexpected and 4th episode is just crazy
23 April 2021,Lordy. 8/19 av?! Havin a larf,1.0,
18 January 2021,This is going to be a mad ride,10.0,"Paul & Lizzie rocking it with their vintage performances. Loving it so far, getting ready for more action further. Rewatching for more easter eggs"
15 January 2021,This is not a top show!,5.0,"So listen up, Im a huge marvel fan and I see the direction that they want to go with this show. The bewitched part is ok, the small clues are nice if you notice. but it is boring as hell. maybe the season gets better, lets see. for now even two stars is high."
15 January 2021,Sad About Comedy These Day !!!,2.0,After 2 episodes simply horrible..As a fan & grew up in the 50's & 60's TV era this is pathetic..I dont mind the B&W concept also the cheap fake laughter but even in the golden age of TV that laughter was because it WAS FUNNY..I got maybe 1 laugh through 2 episodes.. dont know where this show is going..I think everyone is better off popping in a DVD rerun of Bewitched..My Favorite Martian or I Dream of Jeannie..you will be better off satisfied ..Comedy has died !!
16 January 2021,Strange Show,3.0,"I find this show very unusual ,weird,odd etc. My question is where does this fit into the timeline situation of things . Because did'nt the Vision get destroyed in Avengers Endgame ?"
16 January 2021,Crap crap crap crap,1.0,"Not for me personally. I wouldn't recommend it. Found it to be cheesy, slow and irritating. I won't be watching more personally but I know people out there will love it. But I thought it was crappy crap lol"
22 February 2021,BRILLIANT,9.0,What is going on with the bad reviews? MCU manage to put some comedy in an action series which i found genius! I personally loved the first 2 episodes. And the plot was so great i don't know why are you saying that it has a lack of plot. Are we watching a different series or what ?
19 February 2021,Pretty great,9.0,"I'm enjoying several aspects of the series, especially the creative vision making it so much more reminiscent of the feel of a comic book than hardly any comic book based shows have been in ages and ages, maybe ever. Bravo."
27 March 2021,Experimental MCU project,7.0,"WandaVision begins in westview where wanda and vision are married and living as a couple. Later wanda gives birth to two boys. Their life is showcased in a sitcom format of various generations. Those who watched infinity war and endgame will have a wierd feeling watching this and the rest of the show os what is the reason for this proceedings.

It was very heartbreaking to see what happened to wanda and vision in infinity war. So watching them living as a happy couple gives you some sort of joy even though it's not real. This is Elizabeth olsen's show all the way. She conveys all the emotions of wanda perfectly. The concept shown is interesting showing that MCU is going in a different track. The production design deserves full credit for recreating those sitcom format. This show makes us to know why wanda is called Scarlett witch though nobody calls her that anywhere.

The minus points I felt that was the first 3 episodes. It looked interesting but lacked entertainment. After the 3rd episode things start getting clear. And the final two episodes turns into typical good vs evil mcu stuff which fans will enjoy.

And why didn't wanda not ressurect her parents and brother too? Then all of them would live as a happy joint family. Also some characters were not used well like the xmen quicksilver and darcy lewis who vanished in the last episode without any clarification.

On the whole WandaVision was okayish series for me. Don't miss it, because its connected with doctor strange in multiverse of madness movie."
14 July 2021,Excellent,8.0,Marvel moving upwards...The MCU is expanding and Wanda vision is just the beginning.
15 July 2021,Doesn't really know what it is,5.0,"I watched all the episodes. And no, I'm not really a superhero fan.

The beginning was weird. Somewhat entertaining but definitely not funny. Then there is some action and then the whole thing grinds to a painful halt. I think they were trying to be very emotional and mature but it just gets repetive and boring. This show really takes a swing at every direction and manages to miss everything, it's a mess.

It's very well made I give you that - they threw a lot of money into the production. Acting is mostly fine but there are a few miscasts that are very annoying - I mean the girl from ""2 broke girls"" and the guy from ""Fresh off the boat"". What were they thinking? The worst thing here is the whole story. It's a mess of things that make no sense, especially if you're not perfectly familiar with what has happened in the Marvel universe movies.

All things considered it's only a decent show that I'd describe as ""The Harry Potter movie where everyone was taking acid""."
17 January 2021,A love story,10.0,"Elizabeth Olsen acted well ..... I really enjoyed and laughed at many spot .... Let's see what's happening with wand and vision unreality life... Well, waiting for the next episode"
20 February 2021,Should be rated at least a 9.3,10.0,This show is a masterpiece. You all should see it. It's something else.
7 February 2021,Great show!,10.0,"My new favorite, I love the characters, the premise, the story layout, the costumes, and the set designs!"
9 February 2021,Junk,1.0,Watched the first episode. Watched most of the second episode on fast forward. Abandoned it on the third.
13 March 2021,"Interesting set-up, poor execution",6.0,
21 March 2021,So good,8.0,It was so fun and this couple made a story full of action and fun and drama plus the direction of the scenes was so professional for me i liked this serie so much and it was A quantum leap in the Marvel world
5 March 2021,Decent show,6.0,"I enjoyed most of this show, I found most of the episodes entertaining and intriguing. However, some of them are quite dull and some of them frankly way too short to get anything of substance out of them. Overall, good show."
19 January 2021,I didn't like it. Plz tell me whats wrong with me.,,I've recently found out that it I don't like totally love this show that I'm a hater. But idk I may be wrong but maybe just maybe its a bad show.
16 January 2021,Wonderful show,10.0,
27 January 2021,Another drip-fed Disney+ series,3.0,"Disney+ clearly loves claiming success with series like WandaVision and The Mandalorian that require the viewer to sit thru countless hours of useless side-plots only to show progress on the main story of interest at a Glacial Pace.

Clearly they produce / edit the shows this way to extend the number of subscribers over a longer duration. Cute. So instead of a ton of ads eating up our time, we get bloated / drawn out side plots.

A main story arc that would otherwise take one or two episodes to conclude is painfully drawn out over an entire season or three solely to drive revenue on the subscriptions.

Production quality and CGI wizardry be damned - I'm not going to invest time if the story isn't progressing at pace.

After three episodes of being drip-fed hints in this series - I'm giving up. Just like I did after 2 episodes on Season 2 of The Mandalorian.

God forbid viewers should expect the story to progress in significant ways across every episode.

Boring."
5 March 2021,Honest review from a deep MCU Fan,6.0,"Did not quite do it for me. Felt like the show was built around creating suspense without quite delivering.

Feel like they copped out of a lot of decisions that could have really made this show a lot better, diverse, complex & unique. (Mutants, multiverse) Full villainous Wanda.

I feel like the constant suspense did not come close to Watchmen HBO series did.

Also without spoiling I thought the finale lacked originality, and reused a lot of tropes we've seen before. aka Incredibles and man of steel and the Watchmen HBO series.

I prefer seeing the darker, better written Marvel productions and I was really hoping this show was going to carry on the dark path is set on initially then for the show to end as a light Pixar/film, the ending felt very Antman 2 esk which was a film I wasn't fond off in comparison to the others.

Again, I was probably hoping for more considering the MCU drought. 6.5/10"
6 March 2021,"A slow (but charming) start, an interesting (but flawed) middle and an underwhelming end",8.0,"The start is a little slow, but I don't think it's as bad as most people say. The old sitcom vibe has its own charm. The general story is interesting but the execution could have been better. The last episode is surprinsingly underwhelming and corny.

Some characters are annoying, especially Rambeau and Hayward. I didn't really care for anybody except Wanda and Vision. The special effects are great and one episode in particular is kinda touching.

It's not a bad show but I expected more. I think I prefer the Marvel shows from Netflix.

Final rating: 7,7/10."
30 January 2021,The plot twist tho,10.0,Go Disney this show is awesome I love it so much I can't wait for next Friday
20 January 2023,OMG!,10.0,
15 January 2021,"Yeah, that does not make sense",1.0,"Make a bad ""Lucy"" sitcom with below average Avengers characters? Well, that sucks. Bad jokes, stupid acting, maybe you can stand one episode of some dentist is pulling a tooth off."
15 January 2021,so far so good,,"Well I think giving it a rating would be too quick of me, my little sis liked it a lot so I guess it's not that bad.... although am a bit disappointed tho, I guess that's what happens when a show has a lot of hype, still have hope for it and I guess it will get better. just like someone here said, first season of breaking bad was horrendously boring but it got better in later seasons eventually becoming one of the best TV shows in the world, amna wait till the whole shebang comes out before giving it any ratings or at least half of the show."
15 January 2021,Update: NOT Terrible!,7.0,"This might be Interesting as a one off kinda thing. Like a short film or something. But are they serious about making an entire series like this? Hopefully they are setting the stage for something more interesting. So far a waste of time. Total garbage.

Update Review: After suffering through the first two episodes, I have to update my rating from 1 to 7. The show gets much better. Obviously setting the stage for future MCU series' and movies."
16 January 2021,Great for those who pay attention to details,10.0,"There is something mysterious happening. Clues everywhere. All hidden within an obvious mirage of classic American sitcoms. The acting within this setting is spot on...

It is possible obvious that the people that didn't understand this are either not paying attention or are only interested in non stop action.

For me, this continues Marvels run at shaking up the superhero genre.

DC better take notice. Marvel is now light years ahead of the curve."
3 August 2021,[6.5] Elizabeth Olsen - The worthy Scarlet Witch,6.0,"A nice MCU series with very good acting, CGI-VFX and overally acceptable and in cases very good development, only ruined by the abominable first three episodes and the slightly above average next three. We only have one gem of an episode and that's the eighth one with the ninth (finale) being battle-generic and having a ""sadly ever after"" ending.

The post-credits of the finale don't help WandaVision, as a possible continuation in the next Dr. Strange, cause it's my opinion that the character of Scarlet Witch has so much more yet to offer and that it deserves a whole series of its own with of course a potential second season. So it goes for Monica Rambeau who didn't shine (at all) and whose amazing powers were left on a shelf in limbo."
16 January 2021,Great first two episodes,10.0,For all you people complaining about people rating the show after two episodes. People can change thier ratings. Like when i changed my game of thrones rating from 10 to a 1. So back to my rating. Great fun so far. New and original. Can't wait for episode 3
17 March 2021,Complicated,7.0,"The series is quite fine. The Easter Eggs are on point. The story is confusing. But we know it's a prologue to Doctor Strange & buildup for Wanda. The villain characteristic & backstory is poor as usual of Marvel. Seriously, Thanos is the only villain that made some sense & was promising.

Whatever, you have to watch it for Doctor Strange. So go ahead. It is good though. But not top class."
15 March 2021,I have seen the whole series. Not great,5.0,
4 July 2021,Love it,10.0,
15 January 2021,Pure cringe,3.0,"A real struggle to watch. To all the people saying why review 20% of the show, well that is all I'm going to be watching because it was painfully boring and packed full of cringe. My name is Earl did the ""stuck in a sitcom"" idea much better."
20 February 2021,Literally gets worse every episode!,1.0,"Episode 1 and 2 was ehhh no the best, but starting at episode 3-4-5, its getting really terrible. This show went from ""Eh something to watch on Fridays, I guess"" to ""I wish it never existed"". The recap at the beginning of each episode of ""nothing happened last time you watched 10 minutes of this"" is cherry on top of this travesty. But hey, Iron Man is now jealous of Darcys hacking skills."
26 January 2021,I sense David Lynch in this show.,8.0,"Although on the surface this show appears flat and shallow, there is an underlying darkness that intrigues me. Methinks the reality presented is not a reality at all. Viewers need to be patient as I am sure more will be revealed."
24 January 2021,"Cumbersome, Slow, and Unmemorable.",4.0,
1 February 2021,Great Series in Disguise,9.0,"Patience pays, the series starts slowly but it develops amazingly.This is a great way to introduce a mysterious series without giving too much away.Looking forward to the rest of the season"
16 January 2021,"So far, so good",10.0,"Okay we are two episodes in so rating 10 stars is probably premature but I gotta say, this is INCREDIBLY well done. I'm sorry to the people with low attention spans who get bored with no color or crazy action, but from a storyline and filmography standpoint, I'm HOOKED. It's done so well, it's like I'm watching a 50s/60s TV show... until the brief moments where there's a clear breakthrough that somethings different. They are subtle, like the camera work will change or you'll see a flash of color. It's that level of depth that makes the show incredible. Just be patient guys, I have a lot of faith in this and am VERY invested already!"
4 November 2021,"Be Patient, Its Good",10.0,
18 April 2021,Each episode is more interesting than the other,10.0,I personally like a lot of fantasy movies and this movie was one of the best movies I saw.
23 February 2021,What a masterpiece is it,10.0,Just loved the show amazing series well done Marvel
22 January 2021,Not even worth a try,1.0,"Wish I could delete all those fake and troll 10 star votes. Actually, all votes over 6 and I'm being really generous."
24 January 2021,"I get it, but I dont get it.",3.0,"Seen a few shows with this format a few years back... kind of reminds me of ""I love Lucy"", but worse. Not really fun, jokes are laim, and I think people are only watching this cause its Marvel stuff, and how it has to do with other Marvel Universe things, but on its own, by what I've seen so far on the first 3 episodes, I might wait until its over, and someone just give me a spoiler. Don't think I'll finish this show."
22 January 2021,WandaVision,7.0,"In a franchise where every film is an accessible, predictable and not at all brave product, as difficult as WandaVision still is to evaluate, without a doubt it can be said that it is the most daring and peculiar project Marvel Studios has ever come up with."
14 May 2021,Pure entertainment bliss - what we need more of,10.0,"WandaVision was billed and marketed by Marvel as essentially being an acid-trip, subversive response to Martin Scorsese's criticisms of the MCU's cookie-cutter notions and formulae.

Is that what WandaVision wound up being? Probably not. However, it certainly fulfilled its ultimate goal of having me waiting week to week to see what would happen next. It was such pure entertainment. There are no political themes hammered into your head like in some of the other MCU movies and shows of late. The production values are absolutely top-notch and on par with anything that has probably ever been made. Most importantly, the relationship between Wanda and Vision feels organic and the whole show builds off of that. WandaVision has enough mystery baked in where you are wondering what happens and what is really going on, and it sucks you in.

There is something to be said for Disney and Marvel making a high-quality production that simply entertains you, as opposed to lecturing you. It is also pretty emotional, and left someone close to me in tears by the end of it. WandaVision manages to juxtapose notions of mystery with notions of love along with some of the more stereotypical action components belonging to the MCU.

Loved it."
7 March 2021,Meh...,4.0,Started off interesting but then became pretty over the top and silly towards the end with a boring finale
30 January 2021,MindBlowing,10.0,With the episode 4 now released.I bet the minds will blown at ending of the series. It will also start the whole new Era of MCU. Can't wait to watch remaining episodes.
2 February 2021,A Well thought TV Show,9.0,"This show Is the best Marvel show, when I first heard of it I thought it was going to be about magic and the X-men but it took a completely different route, instead it is about wanda living a supposedly normal life with vision Some people may not like the show because it has taken a different direction but I urge you to watch the show not in a normal Marvel action show but in a family, weird, unpredictable marvel tv show"
16 January 2021,I don't get it!,1.0,It took two of my favorite Marvel characters and turned them into a corny Disney channel show! I couldn't care less if Thanos shows up and it's a virtual simulation or vision is back in Wakanda alive on machines. It's a silly show. Very boring to me. Nuff said!
10 February 2021,Non-Marvel,10.0,Wow what an episode 5 this show is turning out to be the craziest thing marvel ever done and its paying off big Kudos the lead actors
16 January 2021,So far....uh....,5.0,
5 February 2021,Amazing,10.0,So much to it Definetly more enjoyable if you watch breakdown videos and read the comics but incredible either way
6 July 2022,"Starts pretty well, ends... as usual",4.0,
26 February 2021,"Mixed, clever but not always in a good way",7.0,
2 March 2021,Ignore the negative reviews. Those people probably didn't make it to episode 4,10.0,"I swear, this tv show is worth watching. I know it has gotten a lot of hate from some people because it is confusing at first and they claim it has a lack of plot but these people are judging it just because of the first impression they received from watching the first 2 episodes. Yes, the show is really confusing at first but I promise things start making sense later. The series gets really interesting soon and becomes so much more than the lame black and white sitcom people who barely watched it claim it is. I absolutely love the show and I recommend it to anyone who loves marvel."
4 February 2021,Amazing,9.0,After seeing it till episode four many things are clear now. Can't wait for episode 5!
15 January 2021,Too boring.,1.0,Their acting look like child playing. The storyline is too boring. I don't know where the hell moving that movie's direction.
7 February 2021,It's basically ABC's Once Upon A Time,1.0,"As I already said, it's a Marvel twist of Once Upon A Time mix with few other shows. It doesn't help that both properties (Once Upon A Time and WandaVision) are owned by Disney because if I was the creators of OUAT I would sued."
5 March 2021,One of the best Marvel series I've seen,9.0,"What an amazing adventure Marvel has brought us into ! I loved every single part of it. It made me nostalgic, emotional and it uplifted me and comforted me when I needed it."
20 February 2021,MASTERPIECE,7.0,
14 February 2021,An outstanding departure from the typical marvel movies,,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the MCU, and especially Infinity War and Endgame, so nobody was more eager than me to see the hijinks that would happen in WandaVision.

People need to understand that even though the first few episodes are short, there is a LOT of storytelling that happens(so far, the events in this show span various decades of TV sitcom stylings), and nothing reflects the breakneck pace of this show like how rapidly it jumps from the aesthetics of one decade to another.

It's also refreshing to see an offering from Marvel that is pretty much 100% action free. There's no shooting at people, there's no explosions, there's no crazy action scenes, just a much more simpler take, a character study if you will of Wanda Maximoff and her tormented soul. Each episode presents a little bit of a mystery, something to hook you because... you want to know what happens next episode, which is very much the way serialized television works, and I love it.

Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and everybody else in the cast is absolutely fantastic. As of this date(2-13-21), I saw the sixth episode... which promises to really change the whole direction of this show entirely, which also serves as a metaphor for drawing us, the viewers into its amazing, diverse world. The story-telling on this show reflects the most positive aspects of something like The X-files, The chilling adventures of Sabrina(NOT Sabrina, the teenage witch), and even some shades of Star Trek: The Next Generation, most notably within the character of Vision.

I continue to be fascinated with how this show is constantly stretching and playing with the norms of what is possible in a TV show. WandaVision has a lot of heart, soul, great drama and even some great humor and wonderful, genuine surprises sprinkled throughout its complex framework. This show is mandatory viewing for those who love the MCU, can't get enough of it and need their MCU fix... who am I kidding? This show is for everybody."
23 May 2021,Average show strictly for MCU fans,6.0,"Wandavision was average, and watchable only if you are ardent fan of MCU. The mystery is built in first few episodes and unfolds in the later episodes but honestly the series doesn't add anything new to MCU. Elisabeth Olsen was good though."
14 February 2021,Not every thing Marvel does is 'amazing'.,2.0,"I watched the first 5 episodes before pulling the plug. This whole show is high-concept gone mad. It might have sounded cool having the show look like a different sit-com every week but it was a gimmick that wore thin after ten minutes.

The other problem is Vision and Wanda really aren't all that interesting. Good side kick characters in a big movie like the Avengers Infinity War, etc, but fairly boring when they are the mains.

Well, as you can see, it's not a series for me. I'm glad others are getting something out of it though. But I will be tuning into something else."
17 January 2021,yet another reason for READING,10.0,"Wandavision, what a joke... Thank you Disney Corp! For giving me yet another reason to keep coming back to my good old comic books. IF there is a big payoff later on, you HAD to have released the whole thing at once, since there are viewers that will drop out before the 1st episode reachs its half mark (as I did). I am entirely not interested in the history and celebrities of glamourous Hollywood and the ""great"" TV shows and movies of the past; I think all of this is terrible, and actually a detriment to good story telling. I find these old shows, and anything with a laugh track, HORRIBLE. I am having none of this nonsense. Do yourself a favor and go read House of M, for a better use of your precious time."
25 January 2021,Full of Intricate Details. You'll Have to Watch it More Than Once.,10.0,"I'm not sure what's with all the negative reviews, but they clearly show that a lot of people are expecting this to be Marvel's typical run-of-the-mill, action filled movie, and that's not what this is.

I was unsure of it at first, and I did think the first two episodes were a bit of a drag, but I became hooked after episode three. Nothing like this has really been done before on TV and by Marvel of all studios so this is a big deal. I think in order to enjoy this you have to watch it more than once to catch all of the details. Trust me, I've seen it twice, watched theory videos on YouTube and I STILL missed out on a lot of intricate details. There's a ton of thought that went into making this and it's amazing to see. You really have to pay attention to everything going on, cause while it seems like it's just one episodic plot after another, they're all tying together into something much bigger. I'm trying my hardest to keep this spoiler free but basically after I discovered there's so much I missed out on on the first watch I didn't want to blink the second time through so I wouldn't miss a single thing.

Personally I like seeing this side of Marvel. WandaVision draws you in because it's so different from anything we've seen from them before. I guarantee if you watch a couple of theory/Easter Egg videos you'll enjoy this show a lot more. Seriously. Give it chance before you leave a negative review calling it boring just because it's not another average superhero movie. What a great way to feature two underrated superheroes. It's about time we see them shine."
16 January 2021,Pathetic,,
20 January 2021,too clever by half,1.0,"Too much laugh track, too little plot.. Parody of old sitcom is not funny... at all... Very labored acting and why not, since who can put heart and soul into such poor material..?"
6 February 2021,5 episodes out of 9 on season 1 just to clear Wanda is living in denial ?,1.0,
19 January 2021,Cancel This,2.0,"I haven't watched the show, but from what I can already see, is that I hate the black and white vibe. Also, it doesn't show that much comedy; this is probably the worst MCU TV show I have watched."
5 March 2021,Weakest link in MCU.,1.0,A total let down and a disappointment after expecting too much from WandaVision! Plenty of loop holes in the story. So much confusion and no clarity behind the introduction of new characters. Waste of time!
20 January 2021,There's zero point rating it until the end of the season.,,"The one major criticism I've got from the first two episodes, is the fact it's been released episodically, rather than in one go. The style / formula Disney has gone for (for better or for worse) isn't going to sit well with casuals, and will probably lose them a lot of viewers. As far as the first two episodes are concerned, I sadly didn't enjoy them at all, it just didn't work for me. Although I'll stick with it, with my fingers and toes crossed that it gets better, and rate it accordingly once the seasons finished."
16 January 2021,Marvel fans would rate a coconut 10 out of 10 if it had a picture of Iron Man on it.,2.0,"The best thing to do is watch this yourself. Marvel die hard will give this a high rating based on what they think ""might happen"" or because a toaster in the show is branded to a certain link in MCU. Based on the first 2 episodes I've watched I'm really struggling to justify watching a third. Bethany and Olsen are both very fine actors and their skills are obvious in these episodes but this series looks bizarre and dare I say it...uninteresting.

I know it's going to be building up to something with a random reference of the MCU that may pop up here and there but I think it will be dragged out massively...in short...I'm not convinced by this.

Just as a footnote. The fanboys criticising the low marks after 2 episodes are rating it very highly...after only 2 episodes! Ironic!"
17 March 2022,It's fine if you like super hero movies,5.0,"It's just OK. Not great. My main complaint is the length. Every scene, and I do mean every scene is at least 2-3 times longer than it needs to be. We seriously don't want to watch laser tag for 5-10 minutes at a stretch. A real snoozefest."
24 March 2021,Wanda- A Scarlett Witch! This show is fire🔥.,8.0,"This is a great show with 9 episodes out of which you have to go through first 3 episodes which are for the buildup of other 6 episodes. Keep watching this show with all your mind and focus. It was introduced as a sitcom at first but this show was much more than that as we all have expected too, this show creates base for some upcoming mcu movies like Dr. Strange, Captain Marvel , Avengers etc. I don't know the reason for all the hate for this show maybe the immature audience who left this show in between or maybe because they have trouble in digesting whats really going on here. This show was not released with all its episodes on one day but we had to wait for every episode , every week and i now think it was a good decision its not for just one go coz its hard to let all this in one go and binge watch due to buildup in first 3 episodes ending felt kinda rushed but i think it was great , the show is mainly focused on wanda , she is the boss here🔥. Wanda is now officially the most powerful avenger in existence. She is scarlett witch and even more powerful than sorcerer supreme , which has its own explaination and i kinda liked that. Don't pay attention to negative reviews watch this show now, if you haven't. Thanks."
17 January 2021,Remember this review!,10.0,"It will be legendary for marvel fans, Just wait for it! It's just the beginning of phase 4 after one year of nothing. Marvel takes a risky, bold and wierd move that many people may not like. Personally, I loved it so far and I liked this amout of Easter eggs and hidden messages that made for both MCU and marvel comics fans."
13 February 2021,Lost Interest as it went on,6.0,
27 April 2021,"Great first 6 episodes, but a flat final stretch",7.0,
19 February 2021,Do not judge a book by its cover,10.0,Do not judge a book by its cover Please do not rate the show until all of its episodes are out just rate each episode one by one
15 January 2021,Only a matter of time before the MCU hit a bum note,1.0,"You know how you wait with baited breath for a next episode

Well after the first 2 episodes I can safely say I'll catch up as and when on the rest of this series

To be fair it set such a low bar it won't have to do much to improve

Poor is a compliment"
24 January 2021,I feel insulted !,1.0,"This show shouldn't be allowed to exist it's an absolute joke! There is nothing good, funny, interesting or clever in this it's just awful. But hey it has the Marvel label so pretentious fans gonna call this a masterpiece that only intelligent people can get! 25M dollars an episode for this result, 7 minutes of credits...yeah i call that an insult !"
12 February 2021,A masterpiece of teleVision,8.0,"To start off, WandaVision is an acquired taste. Not everyone is going to like the incredibly slow-building mystery and drama woven into the old sitcom style. You'll need to see the first four episodes to see if it's for you. With that said, if it is for you, you will ADORE this series! The comedy is hilarious, the production design top-quality, the pacing is perfect (again, if it's your thing), the mystery gripping, and the drama is masterfully written! A perfect series so far, easily the best Disney+ original (though The Mandalorian comes very, very close), and one of the best entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date."
16 July 2021,Legion > WandaVision,7.0,Long story short: WandaVision is Legion (2017) for basic people.
22 January 2021,Taking a lot of time to explain where Wanda and Vision may be,8.0,"Right now, it's all incoherent stuff, or so it feels. Without giving us much of chance to know where this is going. That was ok for 2 episodes. The 3rd one carried on without giving much more. Makes the whole thing appear to be an execute to do one silly or strange thing after the other. That whole stork scene really got on my nerves. It's getting frankly annoying without progress into the story"
29 January 2021,Fantabulous,10.0,"This show has everything one many not expect from mcu, We got to see 50s, 60, 70s without any time travelling, From episode 3 series has become more interested, Every friday we get 1 episode and between two friday, I wait for the upcoming episode episode like unemployed fellow, It feels like marvel is testing patience of its viewers...Must watch for everyone and especially for those who were giving bad ratings in very starting of the series."
19 December 2021,ELIZABETH OLSEN SHINES.....,6.0,
7 March 2021,Amazing show!,10.0,"This show was amazing! There were many fan theories out there but honestly, I liked how it ended. It is a little hard to get through the first 2-3 episodes. I loved all of them but after 3 it really picked up!I definitely recommend watching it."
19 February 2021,Best thing heppend to the MCU!,10.0,It just gets better and better and better and better first two episodes were pretty good too ngl 8/10 but after that 10/10.
8 February 2021,I'm sick of hearing fanboys rave about this show,6.0,"I simply don't get the hype. I have enjoyed nearly every piece of Marvel content to date but I am confused by the popularity of this show. I have never heard anyone say they wanted a rehash of early sitcoms(complete with lame, outdated humour). Now to be fair its kind of unique and its getting better with each episode, but there is so little progress each week. The final episodes are going to have to be pretty spectacular to save it."
15 January 2021,Not what I was expecting.....,6.0,...but I'm not going to knock it after only 2 episodes. Have to see where this is going and that takes all 9 episodes.
6 March 2021,Piece of trash,1.0,This series is nonsense and chaotic. What was the purpose of releasing it? A true waste of time. But the actors are very good though. Except Kathryn Hahn. She is sooooo annoying!
13 February 2021,Wanda in the Middle,10.0,
13 February 2021,Stay with it,9.0,Up until episode 3 I was ready to quit the show...but trust me as soon as episode 4 hits everything starts to make sense and I started to enjoy the show.
15 January 2021,Great first two episodes!,9.0,The people who are review bombing the show clearly don't understand that these are two of nine episodes that all lead up to something. In reality this show currently has been great and I can't wait for next Friday.
15 January 2021,WandaVision is a great way to start phase 4,10.0,"This is one of the boldest, if not the boldest series ever."
15 February 2022,I am horrified people see this as entertainment,1.0,"Watching the first episode, I thought to myself: This is just trash. Surely I had to be misunderstanding something. The ratings on imdb were great, so I risked wasting some more time and watched 4 more episodes until I finally pulled the plug. Enraged over having wasted several hours on something that just brought me frustration, I want to warn anyone else to not make the same mistake.

I just want to ask. Where is the entertainment? What is funny, exciting, sweet, scary or interesting here?

Does some people get off on some sort of perceived superiority by mocking everyone and everything that does not fit into the modern woke identity politics agenda? Is mockery and scorn all that is needed for a great show these days?

If that is true, I have to ask what's left for the rest of us?

The only good thing I could find here was the costumes and set decor."
17 January 2021,Horrible - Don't waste your time,1.0,An tv show's first episode is supposed to draw you in and get you to watch the 2nd episode with Wandavison they fail to draw you in after 2 episodes. It's just plain and boring !
27 February 2021,Stick with the show,8.0,
30 August 2021,Only haters will take half an hour to rant about something they hate,10.0,Seriously this show is awesome. People that like it just rated it 10 and went on with their lives. No one will give this a helpful review but it's still gonna count towards the overall rating.
22 January 2021,Good Show if you are familiar with the comics but Slow if you only know MCU,8.0,I think this show would have benefited if it was 40min. I like it b/c I already know the greater impact it will have on the MCU and I am just along for the ride. yes the acting is over the top and corny. but that's what make it great it show the range of the actors and lets them have a little fun.
8 February 2021,Comic Book live-action has grown up A LOT (And non-reader fans should too).,9.0,"Since there isn't anything unsaid already, i'm just gonna lean into the mystery that WandaVision is for some people.

I don't know what some ''reviewers'' expected from this. Marvel Studios didn't just came up with it from thin air. From the get-go, it is a COMIC BOOK STORY (like all the others) of Wanda, pretending to live at the suburbs with Vision as a married couple, in a Golden Age backround. Comics have their fair share of that too, they're not like ''pew-pew'' lasers all the time. Quite the contrary, quirkier representations of otherwise everyday problems like family drama and disfunctional character psyche, are a big part in the books. And now that you are lured in by 20 years of movies filled with mostly one aspect, the time has finally come to meet another one.

And how could you enter this very new and uncharted perspective? By watching the first scene with Wanda/Vision washing the dishes at home and fight inter-dimensional beings on the second? Please. Even if it seems and sounds like only a soap opera to you, the dialogue hints A TON of what's next (Except if your attention is earned only with explosions and slow motion mid-air falls, then i'm sorry you probably lost your way from the Bayformers Universe).

Look, i get it. If you are a millennial or something, you might hear something like the laugh track and say: ''Why the hell was that funny?''. Understandable. But that's not at all the comical intention. The point is, back then those one-liners and situations used to be funny - and now the joke is our past selves, laughing (A 4rth wall break, like the product of Wanda's actions itself). A bit of the same goes for the rest of the elements, there is nothing in the show without a second meaning or connection with the action-packed stuff.

On the other side, if you are a fanatical chauvinist of the ''competition'' (like if that even still exists), i may find it gratuitous but i also get it. It's not easy to see the ''enemy'' expand by pushing on uncharted territories, when your ''wearing colours'' keep failing on the basics. It sure hurts, but maybe you have to let go of it, as I did back in my childhood. If both of the frontrunners had live-action garbage, i'd just stick exclusively at each one's book series. But at least i'm not afraid to say that i LOVE at least one movie and one movie trilogy from DC, and that i HATE at least two Marvel live-action projects. Cleverly made material, is good material - period.

In each case, give WandaVision a chance again when you're older (physically or mentally). You will appreciate it more, guaranteed."
13 March 2021,Almost the best thing Marvel has Released,8.0,
5 March 2021,This is what a masterpiece is called,10.0,This was truly a new experience for MCU fans. The story was dark and complex too. After viewing each episode it was getting more exciting.
19 January 2021,Sad MCU turn,1.0,"I see all the reviews giving high rating stating: wait for it, why are you giving it bad rating after only 2 episodes, you don't get it... there is nothing to get, it's just plain bad! And why are you giving 10s when it just sucks?

ultimately we are giving bad ratings because it is bad, don't give it a 9-10 based on expectations... it is slow, it is not funny, it is not interesting.. i've skipped through the 2nd episode cause i was so bored!

really bad, that's all that can be said of those 2 episodes."
6 March 2021,Almost amazing,7.0,
5 March 2021,Disappointed,6.0,"It promised so much. But the resolution is nothing compared with all the thing that could've had happen.

Spent too much time with the sitcoms.

The end is not good, the fights are mmm regular to put it in a way.

They could've put more effort on the CGI The had the chance to develop way more into the characters but it just looks like they rush to close the series before to explain maybe a bit better with one more chapter."
14 February 2021,Amazing!!,10.0,"Amazing tv-show it starts off in the 50s the first 2 episodes don't make senses u will be so confused But the 3,4,5 and 6th are amazing and so good and explains everything

I suggest u watch it immediately"
5 March 2021,HONESTLY THE MCU FIX I NEEDED,9.0,"It's a bit slow, first three episodes were not great. BUT they are very important to the story. Honestly, I really really enjoyed this and had goosebumps a few times. Persevere if you aren't sure and honestly read up online after each episode as the Easter eggs will amaze you!"
29 January 2021,Starting is slow but after 3 episodes 🔥🔥🔥,10.0,"WandaVision is an American web television series, based on the Marvel Comics superheroes of the same names. The series is a sequel to Avengers: Endgame and a prequel to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."
22 January 2021,American Sense Humour,7.0,Very hard to like this show. Very slow & bad acting
7 August 2022,Super,10.0,"I love Wanda and the powers Wanda has, the emotional growth all the characters have. And overall love the series. I'm hoping for more seasons!! Elisabeth Olsen just is an amazing acress."
17 January 2021,A pleasant surprise,5.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I watched Wanda vision I was expecting it to be some sort of confusing super hero series but instead it felt like a mix of the avengers bewitched and maniac I am looking forward to ep 3
21 January 2021,Seriously?!,1.0,This show should be used to measure the number of Marvel's fan boys out there.
20 March 2021,Stick with it!,10.0,"Found myself asking why I was watching the series during the first couple of episodes but stick with it; it pulls you in during episode 3. Definitely a worthwhile binge, lots of references to other marvel characters and plenty of easter eggs to watch out for. Family safe too!"
24 January 2021,Ambitious but ...,2.0,"Feels like 3 filler episodes in a row. Very slow.

Would you watch Breaking Bad if you just saw Jesse or WW just hiding without knowing what they do or hiding from whom or what's really going on

An hour and a half in and you're still trying to figure out who is who and who the villain is. Even Anime villains reveal their final forms faster than this."
6 March 2021,Its reallly good!,10.0,You'll understand everything when you watch ep. 4...
10 May 2022,Just a glimpse of my opinion of WandaVision,10.0,"This series is the best thing I've seen. The series I enjoyed is very receptive, beautiful, enthusiastic, and best of all, my dear Elizabeth, who I love. She gave the best performance. I love her. I can't stop repeating this series.

You have to believe, I'm obsessed with the series."
6 March 2021,Disappointed,5.0,
11 March 2021,A masterpiece,9.0,
12 March 2021,Best,7.0,Actually I didn't wanna watch it but then I saw some clips on YouTube and wallah! Am in episode 6 Disney it's a good one
29 March 2021,Taking Marvel fans outside their comfort zone,9.0,"Disney+ finally started the 4th round of MCU with a new TV series ""WandaVision"". It blends the style of classic sitcoms with the MCU in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision -two super-powered beings living their ideal suburban lives- begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems. The show is very different and demands a viewer to pay attention because the weirdness hides the mystery, which will blow people away at the end of the season. Marvel is showing a bold creative side and their faith in their fans. It will work best as a whole season, but no worries - the patience will be rewarded, so just enjoy."
10 March 2021,Started great.... weak ending,5.0,"What a refreshing different approach...great actors like Eilsabeth Olson, Paul Bettany, Evan Peters. Quirky, dark, funny, interesting and then it turnend it into the typical generic CGI showdown. And I can't forgive Marvel what they did with Evan Peters. Ralph Bohner...not funny at all."
29 January 2021,Wait till episode 4 and you will sure love it,10.0,"At first you will feel confused and lost till episode 3. But from episode 4 , everything will be clear. And i am loving it! 😍"
17 February 2022,good,7.0,"I had a lot of trouble enjoying the beginning, the main plot takes a long time to appear and it took me several days to watch the first three episodes, but once launched it was really captivating."
17 January 2021,"""Tranquility Lane""",1.0,"It reminds off the ""Tranquility Lane"" quest of the game fallout 3. Objects are also pointed out by being coloured in a black and white environment. And you hope you'll find an exit soon, cause it's boring as hell.

The series is slow and the first two episodes are hard to watch. Hope it goes somewhere, but saw in the episode list a picture of 70's like pixel coloured and the actress wore clothing of such an era. So my detective skills say it will be something through time.

Spoiler... google wanadavision + decades

The actors can act well but the show is slow and boring. Episodes of 20 minutes feel like an hour. Marvel has such good stories to choose from, so why did they decide this? I'm not going to continue watching."
6 February 2021,Original,10.0,Pretty freekn' good. MCU does not disappoint again/\
16 February 2021,AMAZING,10.0,"Although the first three episodes didn't make much sense to me, it really grew on me after that and it left me hanging. Amazing!!"
19 February 2021,Its boring and repetitive,4.0,"After seven episodes, all looks the same boring and repetitive plot, cameos and special guest cant fix it. Just another Disney out of the production line product."
30 January 2021,Wanda vision,10.0,Amazing web series of Wanda and vision they show theories they can exist
15 January 2021,Awful,1.0,Black and white and the characters not even been there marvel selfs even vision reverts to his own human face
24 March 2021,Excelent...,10.0,
21 January 2021,WOW!,9.0,I like how the show keeps its mystery on the first two episodes. My only issue with WandaVision is the credits. The credits are so long that it makes you think that there is a post credits scene (which there is not) so i ended up watching just not to miss any scenes.
16 January 2021,This can't be the show right?,2.0,"First let me start, I am a huge marvel fan and have read comics etc but I've watched the first two eps painfully. This is literally just a TERRIBLE re make of bewitched. It's corny jokes and laughing track it's unbearable. They are super heroes that can take on the world yet were frightened and hid under the blankets when a tree branch slaps against a window. I honestly don't understand the rating on this as this is utter garbage. I will however push through and keep watching to see if it gets better, otherwise will scroll social media on my phone until the episode finishes."
19 February 2021,Super slow,4.0,"Ignore fan reviews. They will go gaga over anything made by Disney-Marvel.

The series is super slow drama. Storyline might be good bits just something to be done in 2-3 episodes."
21 April 2021,Must approach with an open mind- a really original show,10.0,"This has to be one of my favourite shows I have watched recently.

When I first started viewing I was slightly disappointed, as it didn't really fit the typical Marvel style. But as the show progressed, I became quickly addicted. It contained plenty of plot twists, action scenes and lighthearted comedy. Wandavision is in my opinion, the best thing Marvel has produced. It really gave some insight into Wanda's character and how she dealt with the grief she'd experienced in her life.

Overall I would say it is a most intriguing and exciting show- definitely worth the watch."
24 March 2021,A great superhero drama,7.0,"Wanda Vision is a tv series that I really liked. I did not expect to get interested in it because I did not understand much from the trailers. I realized that actually, the mystery of this tv series is what makes it good. As the audience, we got deep into Wanda's character and felt his traumas and depression with her. Marvel managed to demonstrate the emotions very well. The episodes got more interesting every time and gave the audience exciting hints for the next episode, made people wait for the Friday impatiently. It is very successful at hyping people. It has a great way of storytelling which the story enlightens and completes itself as the episodes go on.

On the other hand, there were also things in this TV series that made me upset. The first episodes seemed sort of unnecessary to me. There wasn't really an event going around throughout those episodes, and I believe that they could have combined all of them in one episode so that they would have released more episodes with major events. People also expected to see more things at the end of the Wanda Vision but got disappointed in the final. I was one of those people who got disappointed. The Series got exciting in every episode and naturally increased the expectations, but fan theories boosted people's expectations. Besides the fan theories, I also thought that more things could have happened since they told us that this Tv series plays a significant role in the upcoming movie Doctor Strange 2. I also believe that the last episode could have been divided into two episodes, so that fight sequences and the drama scenes would have been more emphasized.

In summary, even it doesn't meet many people's expectations, Wanda Vision was a great TV series with excellent drama and good action sequences. I would ensure that many people will be glad to finish it. I know that not much has happened for many people, but it still has to be watched to understand what will happen in the Phase 4."
5 March 2021,If you can manage the first three episodes,7.0,"If you can get through the first three episodes the rest of the series is about an 8.5. The first three slowly get better but are bad spoofs of old sitcoms with laugh tracks and the first two are in black and white. They actually set up the rest of the show but aren't needed. If you really can't stand them, skip to episode four. You'll miss some context but not much and you'll catch up pretty quickly."
19 January 2021,??????????????,,Why is everyone rating this? At least wait for the series to finish. You can't judge an entire series on 2 episodes.
29 April 2021,Worst thing to happen after COVID-19.,1.0,You guys applaud Disney and Mickey will end up buying our water supply and you'll still defend them. Butchering the comics. And Wanda actress is as bad as Gal Gadot WW. Painful to finish.
16 January 2021,What the heck is this show?,,I didn't find this show interesting at all. Couldn't finish even 1 episode.
15 January 2021,It's Wanda-ful to have Marvel back!!,10.0,"2020 was a very depressing year without new Marvel films/TV show. 2021 is off to a really good start with WandaVision. So it takes place after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and Wanda and Vision are happily married, living their life like a 50/60s TV sitcom, but not everything is what it seemed.

I've only seen the first two episode of it and it's brilliant!! Very cleverly done on how the made it like we were watching a real TV sitcom from the 50s. Elizabeth Olson and Paul Bettany were brilliant as the two leads and it looks like they were having the time of their life filming this show. My only criticism is that I wish Disney realised the whole season because I want more!!!!!! Still, this will make up my Fridays. It's good to have Marvel back and I can't wait for more upcoming projects for Phase 4."
15 January 2021,What a waste of talent and budget,1.0,"What a waste of talent, budget and most of all opportunities. They've wasted the first two episodes on this ""bewitched"" parody storyline... The result is painful, slow-paced and very different from what we usually get from Marvel. It seems to me that the writers at Disney had a very different target audience in mind for this one..."
8 March 2021,Blown Away,8.0,"Finally watched WandaVision, I've been waiting for the whole thing to come out so I could watch it as a whole. Absolutely loved it. So much better than it had any right to be. I had high expectations and it still beat those, it was so cleverly written. There's literally 20+ things in every episode that has a reference or hidden meaning. I still can't believe how much they crammed in to 9 episodes. I think it's up there with the best of the MCU, maybe even the best season of a superhero tv show I have ever seen."
16 January 2021,The Death Of The MCU,1.0,"Well there we have it, End Game was the MCU last hurrah! The Wandavision catastrophe could this mark the end. The worst superhero in comic book history (Vision) ohh how we celebrated when Thanos crushed his stupid purple head. Why anyone would think it would be a good idea to make a series around him is beyond belief, did none of the producers see Age Of Ultron! Utter pap."
5 August 2022,It's A Wandaful Life,7.0,"I have to confess I'm not up to speed with the MCU at all. I think I watched the first Avengers movie years ago when it came out and just sort of never followed through, preferring instead to watch the Marvel TV series (""Daredevil"", ""Jessica Jones"" etc) which I have generally found to be excellent. However with my penchant for classic American sit-coms, I was intrigued by the premise of this show and so, knowing nothing at all about the title characters I waded in to see where it would take me.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Even though I knew nothing about the preceding back-stories for Wanda and Vision, I immediately warmed to the characters and was intrigued by their predicament, being stuck in the TV sit-coms of every decade since the 60's. So it was fun to pick the tropes out of those before inevitably the science kicked in and resolved everything for the MCU-ers out there.

It must have been nice for the actors too to walk in the footsteps of Lucy and Desi, Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler-Moore amongst others before the ""Truman Show"" aspect was stripped away and it became a good old-fashioned battle beween good and evil leading to Wanda's inevitable repeat sacrifice at the climax.

Obviously that reference to ""The Truman Show"" and of course not forgetting the marvelously original British TV series ""The Strange World Of Gurney Slade"" of the early 60's are just two reminders that the basic idea here isn't wholly original but the sinister twist in the tale and superior production values of today help to compensate for this.

I really liked the acting of the two leads and especially that of the nosey neighbour / wicked witch character. Yes, I was a little lost by the end as the denouement played out, but maybe that's a hint for me to go back and play catch up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I guess it would have been easy for the show-runners here to imagine up a conventional goodie v baddie series for the Vision and Scarlet Witch characters, so fair play to them for attempting this daring and innovative approach to the traditional superhero TV series."
12 February 2021,starts off good but then goes downhill,2.0,"1st episode was good then gradually goes downhill and becomes more silly, more corny and more predictable..by episode 4 already losing interest fast..."
17 March 2021,It was great,10.0,
3 January 2022,Is that show supposed to be funny?,5.0,"The trailer of the show seemed a bit weird to me, but given an excellent rating of more than 8 out of 10 on this website I decided to give this show a try. I'm massively disappointed by the lazy jokes and refuse to watch more than three episodes of this unfunny garbage."
17 January 2021,Color me intrigued,8.0,"I rarely rate or review shows this early on with only two episodes to work with but, this is one of the rare cases that after watching the first episode I know that I am going to love this series! Right away, I loved how unique and different Wandavision is compared to quite literally anything else within the MCU. I found the episodes that we have received thus far to be very entertaining as well as interesting, definitely enough to color me intrigued! Wandavision has massive potential and I look forward to seeing where this takes the MCU."
1 April 2021,Definitely worth the wait for all episodes,10.0,Fantastic! Is what I have to start off with this is one of my new fav series marvel did really good and also Disney plus tbh and it's so sad how it's underrated! But one of the best shows hands down.
16 January 2021,Marvel and Disney rule small screens even better than theatre!,10.0,"Must admite i haven't expected that much level of hidden clues in good mystery packed in sitcom version of Marvel superhero tv show. Its next level of tv show and Marvel made impossible again and pioneered one more time amazing content for us viewers. And acting power is amazing and abounded, from power couple to neighbours or working colleagues etc... This is how you make new superheroes in tv.I love it."
21 January 2021,"Bold New Direction, Creative, Brilliantly Done Homage!! Really?",3.0,"Yes, I was paying attention - both to the show and these ratings.

I watched due to the high ratings and hype. So disappointing..

BUT, it was an amazing fresh idea to do the show as ""an homage to classic sitcoms"". Who ever would've thought of that?

Well, there was Pleasantville in 1998, Rosanne (Season 7 Ep 26) 1995, Medium (Season 1 Ep 11) 2005. The Medium episode was in black & white and had a laugh track.

I didn't find WandaVision funny, clever, or fresh. But hey, if you find recycled ideas from 25-15 year shows, with tons of references to other shows and Easter eggs to be creative and amazing, knock yourself out. Bold New Direction, Creative, Brilliantly Done Homage!! Really?"
31 January 2021,Excellent,8.0,I am impressed. It gives greater insight after what happened immediately after endgame. Also there were some returning characters which was very fun to watch. Also the story is good. There is humour. Overall a must-watch for MCU fans
6 March 2021,A tonic for those tired of MCU,10.0,"This show is so unique and so very Marvel at the same time. We watched all the shows as a family and despite my wife starting to feel fatigued with the MCU but this show kept her interest throughout. Friday nights are now Marvel nights in our house.

I hope there is a season 2 somewhere down the line and they explore this some more."
2 April 2021,So good,10.0,Made my puthy throbatron easily my favorite marvel series / best thing in the MCU even my favorite part was ofc the cast and acting but I adore the score and the motifs used in the score I picked up on a lot of common motifs in the music and enjoyed it a lot yas so good slay city.
24 January 2021,Bizarre - Unfunny - Uninteresting,1.0,"Wow! How do they manage to squeeze so much bad into one series? Not funny enough to be a sitcom; not interesting enough to be a drama, not even a good sci-fi - bad acting, bad writing, bad concept. Makes absolutely no sense. The credits are practically as long as each episode and so far the most interesting part - and that's not saying much. Keep your social media or a pillow handy to escape the boredom. A total trainwreck! What was Disney thinking?"
19 January 2021,Don't waste your broadband... *update*,9.0,"I stand corrected.

I watched the first two episodes, and found them to be terrible. So I wrote a negative review where I literally trashed the show and gave it a 1 rating (see bottom).

Then I noticed people saying that the show really picks up in episode three and four. So I decided to give it one more go and watch one more episode.

And people were not lying! If you make it till episode three, you are truly in for a treat! I was glued to the tv and actually kept watching the fourth one as well.

Now I'm waiting for the next release.

Anyway, I thought it would be only fair to update my review since I misjudged the show, based on the first two episodes.

I really see great potential in Wanda Vision and I'm really looking forward to the next episode. This is good sci-fi, no doubt about that.

And below the line is my old review. I kept it for comparison. ------------------------------------

This show is boring, cheesy, annoying and plain stupid. It's pure garbage.

Perhaps people would have laughed in the fifties, when you had few channels and even less shows to pick from.

I prefer using my 4k TV to watch things in high resolution and color. Not black and white, filmed in 4:3 format, making a large portion of my TV black. Plus, the humor changes with time. Disney+, not sure what you are aiming at, but the only place I see your show running in, is in a retirement home.

I hope this show gets cancelled soon."
15 January 2021,"Hmm, a fishy fishy fishy fish",4.0,"Yes, the ratings are fishy. The episodes - so far, is all over the place (only2 episodes). Maybe the retro theme goes hand in hand with the American audience, hence the 4:3 black and white housewife 50s sitcom feel. Hoping for a slightly darker turn of events ... but so far: zzzz zzzz Personally, this series is just another nail in the coffin for my Disney + subscription."
22 January 2021,Misunderstood I think,9.0,"After 3 episodes I'm really hyped and I'm interested in what comes next. I don't understand the reviews, which complain about humor and jokes. Just look at the genres Disney plus lists. There is no Comedy, for good reason. This show isn't that funny and it doesn't try to. Who thinks, that this is the case just doesn't understand what it's all about. Don't listen to the haters, just enjoy creative & refreshing Marvel content! :)"
29 January 2021,ok but ...,6.0,Marvel quality continues with this series but stretched out way too long. First 4 episodes could have been the first 25 mins of a movie.
20 January 2021,I like it.. very Well done,9.0,"The first 2 episodes are different. I'm a fan of old sitcoms, and it took me a minute to adjust to the setting in the first episode. There's typical sitcom plot structure, but an overall mystery threaded throughout the episodes.

The show took it's time with characters and not a visual effects overload like a typical super hero movie. This is the story of Wanda, the Scarlett Witch. Well done Disney/Marvel."
14 February 2021,It's OK,5.0,"It's good but not that great. You can't waste people's time like that! There's just too much option to watch out there for them to drag the show like that First if all, 7 minutes credit?? Really, marvel? Story line starts at episode 4 when scenery changes, and if you stuck around until then then you're lucky one. The story until then hardly keeps your attention. Then it redirects to very annoying actress from, I think two broke girls or whatever, who aged like hell and still trying to be this quirky young girl. Please. Anywho, I've expected a lot more from rating 8. And I'm disappointed 😞"
17 January 2021,Hard to watch,7.0,"When i started to watch, it felt like i missed out something that a typical American maybe find it fun as... I couldn't digest it, maybe they are plot twists episodes, but not for me. Horrible fake audience laughs, stupid jokes, continues silly moments... I didn't got it. The 2nd episode was more worse and impossible to watch. I just don't understand it."
7 July 2021,Its different,6.0,"I will give marvel props for finally trying something new and Wandavision does take its unique aspect in full drive while offering a good tale of Wanda's own journey of grief regarding Visions death. That being said, the show is quite slow at the start and the ending is unfortunately a bit more of the same MCU beats we've seen before."
28 March 2021,As bad as WW 1984,1.0,"Was advised to skip first 3 episodes, but I decided to persevere, got half way into the first episode before I realised I'd actually tuned out. Moved onto the 4th episode and got 10 minutes in before I gave up. I generally love all things Marvel, but this was mind numbingly boring, I wanted to press on and give it a chance, but I couldn't put myself through it.

Normally the first episode is make or break, but because it was Marvel I was prepared to give ot a chance, save yourself the time and effort. If you can't get through the first episode this series isn't for you."
10 March 2021,Not a marvel fan but LOVE THIS SHOW,10.0,"This show was a debate for me when I realized this is a marvel TV show. When I say I don't watch marvel I mean I've never watched ANY marvel movie. But decided to give it a quick watch. It quickly became an addiction, this show has everything you could ask for.

Total humor emotion character development

even if you have no idea what happened before the movies with vision and wanda you are quickly told what had happened and its just truly amazing. The storyline and each episode is so symbolic and the plot thickens and becomes exciting as each episode progresses. not to mention the cast is wonderful and the actors are attractive. Anyways watch it stop looking at the reviews its so worth it."
15 January 2021,Not getting the hate,9.0,Well it's only been 2 episodes so far but I'm curious already and both episodes did amuse me.
2 March 2021,Great addition to the MCU!,10.0,Sure it's been pointed out that the first 3 episodes can be a bit underwhelming but after that it just keeps getting better! I am so hyped for the finale and can't wait how impactful it may be for the future of marvel!
10 June 2021,Good but not as good as everyone make it out to be!,5.0,Started off slow but really picked up towards the end. I give it a 7 because it ended well.
20 January 2021,Bewitched remake?,7.0,I just watched the first episode and it was like watching a Bewitched episode. Not much else to say.
29 January 2021,Goated,,This is masterpiece best of the year so far. It's so mysterious that it feel like old sitcom with a modern sort of touch.
8 April 2021,Different but Great,10.0,"This movie was different from the original story in comic books but excellent.

I've really enjoyed watching this movie.

I wanna know What will happen in the next seasons of Wanda Vision ?"
5 February 2021,Getting better and better with every episode,9.0,
15 January 2021,There are no words to describe how bad this is.,1.0,"A. I'm a huge Marvel fan. B. This is one of the most horrible, boring, stupid, and asinine things ever conceived by man. C. It isn't interesting, funny, exciting, or worth another 30 seconds of my time. D. The reviews on here are a lie, a lie, a lie. There can't be 5 people in the world besides maybe the actor's mothers who are enjoying this series. E. I'd rather have my hemorrhoids burst than watch 5 more minutes of this disaster."
17 April 2021,One of the most exciting and original shows I've ever watched,10.0,It's just so amazing The first few episodes might be considered boring but you have to trust the process. Every episode builds new things and becomes better and better. Everything about it is thrilling. It makes you think. So happy this was made.
15 January 2021,Unbelievable,10.0,"""The Beginning is the End is the Beginning"". Everyone thought what would be the best in future of MCU and some people considering that MCU was end with Endgame. Well here is the beginning... Wandavision"
18 January 2021,Honestly it's boring. Not sure why it's rated so well.,2.0,
16 January 2021,Love It!!,10.0,"When I saw the first trailers with the black and white sitcom clips, I really didn't know what to expect. After watching the first 2 episodes, I'm hooked.

I find the sitcom bits very funny, and the creepy bits are made much more intense by their contrast to the overall comedic mood.

If you've ever read the 2 Vision and Scarlet Witch limited series from the 80's, Avengers Disassembled, and House of M, you probably have a vague idea of where this story may be headed. I can't wait to see more.

Also, for those who are saying that it is inappropriate to rate the series after only 2 episodes, I respectfully disagree. My rating is based on the episodes that are currently available, but I can update my rating later in the (pretty unlikely, I think) event that the series disappoints down the road. For now, I highly recommend watching the episodes that are available so far.

Take care and be well! :)

Edit: Just watched episode 4 and would like to revise my review to 11 stars - lol. If you're a fan of the MCU, watch this show. You won't regret it. :)"
28 June 2021,no color 'till Season 3?!,1.0,"SO boring. Won't sit for another episode. And these two are such amazing characters and actors? WHAT are you trying to DO here, Disney? Make fun of America's past and fill us with more of your propaganda? YUP. I think so."
16 January 2021,Marvel Mess,1.0,Really boring and totally stupid. First episode is one of the lamest things I've ever seen in TV. The second is not much better. Where's the AVENGERS when you need them?
23 January 2021,"Rate each episode , not the entire series until you've seen it all",10.0,Clearly when you can't binge watch you've got to wait and see what happens. Clearly this show is going somewhere!!
17 May 2021,Brave and brilliant,10.0,"The first few episodes are a bit different to say the least but stick with it and you reap the rewards.

I love that it wasn't your typical series. Brilliant acted, brilliantly filmed and loved it."
23 January 2021,Cool premise. Horrible writing.,7.0,"Ugh! Marvel... What have you done?!

I think this show has a great concept, as I am a fan of nostalgia and old shows as well, but the humor is nonexistent. I haven't laughed once, but cringed multiple times. The scenes where they hint at something deeper going on, are by far the best. Unfortunately, they are few and far between.

Maybe everything will be worth it in the end, but after three episodes, I am doubtful.

I hope the other Marvel shows fare better..."
16 January 2021,a different show,10.0,The show is very good and different than others.worth watching
5 March 2021,Truly an Incredible Stellar Tv Show,,"Right from beginning to end, WandaVision is truly a remarkable & stellar tv show from marvel. It's a bonanza for true marvel fans & I thoroughly relished the entire show. Every actor has given their utmost unparalleled performance. Especially, ElizabethOlsen & Paulbettany literally crushed their roles & their acting transitions through every retro generation is utter extraordinary.

This can only be pulled off by MarvelStudios their new approach, writing, & ingenious direction took it to another level.

I pity people who are expecting a lot more than necessary from the show. It's the theories & conjectures that could ruin your experience. So, just stick to the screen & witness the final showdown of wandavision.

It's so fricking awesome that WandaVision has its own storyline & has its own thing. Also, hands down to aesthetic breathtaking visuals & CGI. I barely can see any blemishes in the show if you disregard the theories. Man, that was the most excellent & unequalled.

Even the music is spectacular. It made the scenes more epic & pleasing. Kudos to everyone who worked for the show."
16 January 2021,So much suspense and mystery,10.0,WandaVision is a perfect start for MCU's phase 4. This time Marvel Studios made a different thing and people are gonna love it. I watched the two episodes and they're fun! I'm looking forward to seeing the remaining episodes too. They are incredible!
25 April 2021,Don't judge a series only by the first episodes,10.0,"Bad reviews were in before about the 3/4th episode, even my friends refuse to watch bcs they were bored but trust me it's your loss if you decide not to watch this one.

The episodes are short but all of the weird un enjoyable episodes means a lot actually, those will finally lead you to details on the next episodes so just keep watching.

My non marvel fanboy managed finishing this series without watching the movies before it. But for better experience, watch at least the avengers movies and you're all set. It's going to be a lovely ride trust me.

I love elizabeth olsen here and i cant wait to see her again in the upcoming MCU projects."
22 February 2021,This is Series was Unbelievable,10.0,Omg so amazing! Marvel seems creating more interesting stories nowadays. 11/10 period.
20 January 2021,Complete Failure,1.0,"This is not Marvel, this is not superheros, and THIS IS NOT FUNNY. This was just awful and painful to watch. Having a root canal was a more pleasurable experience than having to watch this. Just...No."
6 February 2021,Unique,9.0,"I never seen anything like this in a comicbook movies or series. Its engaging, funny and also a pinch of horror."
7 March 2021,It was something,,"The first 2 or 3 episodes I didn't really understand what was going on but later I put all the pieces together and I got on track. My favourite episode was episode 8, it really showed what Wanda went through, this guys really can't give Wanda a break can they?"
22 January 2021,I am glad I was not expecting much...,1.0,"...because I got nothing out of this show. I guess this is Disney and not Marvel, and quality is in line with last decade of Disney crap, trying to profit from nostalgia. Who are they targeting with 4:3 b&w format ? Kids ?"
17 January 2021,"Like expecting to have an Italian dinner, but served oatmeal.",1.0,"Maybe that's what they were hinting at when Wanda served breakfast for dinner? Like a good novel, the reader shouldn't expect to read through a couple of boring chapters to be kept intrigued. Assuming this won't continue to be just a 50's sitcom, they could have shortened this torturous drawn out prelude."
16 January 2021,Good.,6.0,"I like the idea, very original, fun to watch.

But, why are the credits so long?"
17 January 2021,Wanda Vision,1.0,"I predict a quick death.

A painful contrived cross between Bewitched and The Dick Van Dyke Show."
16 January 2021,Slow... but I'm seeing what they're going for,10.0,"Give it time, give it a chance, it's good! At first I was taken aback because it wasn't funny, they're trying too hard to be funny, but again... this is a horror series and not a sitcom. Give it a chance, i can't wait to see more!"
15 January 2021,Cannot believe the negative reviews.,9.0,
10 December 2021,Marvel does sitcoms now,5.0,"Imagine living in a sitcom! I feel like I've seen such an idea before but I don't recall from where.

The whole premise is witty. When we were put into the real world and had the investigations going on, those pieces were really interesting.

Especially Jimmy Woo stole the show and Darcy and Monica were also great.

But I didn't like the show at the beginning. First, it begins all black-and-white. Old school as it is needed for plot-purposes. Marvel can do this because long-time fans already know Wanda and Vision and don't need a fancy first episode. While interesting to see where it might lead to, it was also just kinda bland.

In particular all of these sitcom parts. Oh my, they were so boring and not funny at all - at least for me. I played those at 2x speed because I really couldn't care less. I was interested in the outside investigations.

I also felt like there were so many inconsistencies in the plot. Hayward's objectives just didn't make sense in so many directions. The magicy realm seemed weird and the witchery is also over the top. And why now compare the sorcerer supreme with witches when they don't seem to have much in common? I'm not sure I like these twists, though the Scarlet Witch does seem like an interesting premise.

So though the show wasn't my forte, at least they set up the scarlet witch - and I'm interested to know what they will do with that storyline next. Will Wanda be the next world-threatening enemy in the Marvel universe?"
30 January 2021,I can't understand people's problems with the show,7.0,Being a giant Marvel fan I was eagerly waiting for wandavision and I can admit the first 2-3 episodes were not good but that's what building the plot is called. The fourth episode was just amazing when I saw it and it explained everything so far in a great way and linked everything up which was amazing. People who are hating on it just don't have any amount of patience or don't know how good shows work. They had to build the plot first you idiots.
17 January 2021,Awesome and Mind Blogging,8.0,"Many people saying that this show is boring and needs more potential, they are blank minded, because they aren't trying to get that this time Marvel has tried something really different, the 1st two episodes of are successful in developing it's suspense and ya, the Character development is very strong too."
5 February 2021,Patience is a virtue,10.0,"Netflix's binge culture has destroyed your ability to enjoy content that requires you to wait a bit before it unloads on you. WandaVison may be a slow burner but it's worth the wait and your patience will be rewarded. Also, personally I enjoyed all of the episodes and don't really get the negative reviews."
15 January 2021,Perfect,10.0,Wandavision is perfect in every way and is exacting to have some content of marvel after all this wait.
9 February 2021,Boring,1.0,"What they've done is changed the superhero genre from action to boring mystery. What's next the hulk tv show where he never turns into the hulk!! They spent a whopping 25MILLION per episode and I've not seen even ONE single action scene. I mean it doesn't have to be non stop action, this is not marvel, superhero or action. The acting is good but It's just boring and non eventful. Thank god for the man for the mandorlorian"
15 January 2021,I wanda what's the vision?,3.0,"Some writer thought ""let's make something unique!"" and copied I love Lucy so hard you get all jokes beforehand. It is a well done tribute to the old shows but not everything from the past is good. Plus, the added bonus that this doesn't fit in the MCU timeline even using a shoehorn big as a whale. Maybe it is all a dream? Yes! Let's copy Dallas and be unique!!"
25 June 2021,Didn't Finish,8.0,"Just watched Loki and it really motivated me to complain.

WandaVision isn't that bad. It isn't that good either. I didn't finish, but I actually enjoyed the first episodes. So take that at a glance. I found them entertaining. Don't remember why I stopped, and tempted to watch the rest. But I am not that interested either.

8 Stars is accurate. Watchable and enjoyable, but definitely not for everyone.

There seems to be a dramatic shift in story and pacing, I assume, based on reviews and my own experiences. So expect things to change."
24 January 2021,"Needs to go somewhere, and fast",9.0,"The show gets much better, but they should have dropped the first 4 episodes all at once, not 2. I stand by my original statement that it goes nowhere fast, and the credits are WAY too long.

Original review: I have no idea how people are giving this more than 5 or 6 stars. It needs to go somewhere and fast. We're 3 episodes in and almost nothing of value has happened so far. People are finding all these double meanings that aren't there. The show isn't subtle, it's blatant there's something 'going on' not nuanced like people are implying in their reviews. They need to stop slow walking the audience there and give us some substance, and fast. So far this show is in the bottom quarter as far as quality goes to marvel stuff."
12 February 2021,Full of worth-waiting moments. A MASTERPIECE,10.0,"This is probably one of the best made TV shows I've ever watched. It's rich in comic call-backs, MCU references and much much much more. I've been a fan of this Cinematic Universe for years now and I have never grown so impatient for new episodes to come out. CRAZY MUST WATCH!!"
25 February 2021,People getting paid for negative veiws,10.0,On explanation why anyone's giving this under 8 stars. Has literally every emotion a series could have inside the marvel universe. Using a series to lead into the next phase was brilliant and the only negative thing I can say about the series is it's only 9 episodes. Watch for yourself and ignore the haters.
1 March 2021,Extremely creative,10.0,Marvel have out done themselves! This show has everything you could possibly need and more.
28 April 2021,-,4.0,"Finally, Marvel finds the right format for the elongated stories on which its characters are based and that require the longest duration that the television format offers.

And yet, this mini-series prefers to be justified again by the (not even interesting) later mapping of other materials. It doesn't take the potential of its particular formalisation to the fullest, which here was even more justified and requested, as it is the television structure itself the structural element of the entire series, from the title.

Even in the transition between different sitcoms that each episode presents, we recognise the parallels with the protagonist's own mental and relational situation (with Vision). Where the optimism of what appears to be an idealised life from the 1950s in which the series begins, gives way to a more ironic and (in a way) realistic look at the relationships in question in the 2000s, as the same relationship between Wanda and Vision evolves in the turmoil that she herself created. Even the occasional television ad, appropriating the concerns of each era to equally illustrate some aspect of Wanda's memories, reveals the brilliance of the series proposal. Despite the parallel realities, mystical powers and cybernetic beings, even in the intentionally accelerated evolution of the relationship we recognise a point of realism, to which the actors themselves contribute to a large extent. Olsen and Bettany carry most of the work, in undeniable chemistry and a fun and engaging adaption to each new role.

At specific times, it's even interesting to see an almost metalinguistic exercise in the way we follow the different episodes of the series that Wanda creates. , where we start watching the backstage for the series during the episodes themselves. When the secondary actors question whether they should repeat the scene from the beginning, question the lack of children in the city, or stop their activity in the background, we gradually realise what the strange events might signify, without needing any explanation that the series, from the fourth episode, gives us.

That's how the big and frankly unnecessary flaw in the series arises. After three mysterious but exciting episodes, we go back to the beginning to establish a series of parallel events and characters that in no way contribute, in fact, to the main narrative. If we even accompany Vision discovering what's going on in the city, the series has already revealed it to us (less interestingly). This gives these scenes the sense of an obligatory addition for the establishment of future characters for subsequent films and/or series that take away the narrative interest of the current ones.

In fact, when there was a transition to ""reality"", to the secondary narrative, there was not a single time when my eyes wouldn't roll. Because we're so well involved in Wanda's twisted mind and inability to settle for her own grief, we are simply not interested in anything else. Because we want Wanda to undo the consequences of her own actions from the start, or simply to watch her fail tragically and, thus, only see in the end the consequences of all this parallel creation that brings more (personal) consequences than initially we have notion.

And in the seventh episode, we are already denoting an obvious way of illustrating narratively the conflict within Wanda, where other characters try to prevent her with common speeches, at the same time that Vision continues to participate in the sitcom structure. Thus, even more strange transitions and editions are revealed in a series that, at this point, lost its initially so well placed focus. Even more so when we realize that, regardless of what Wanda created, there are larger forces at play that draw much of the drama up to that point. Wanda ceases to be the vulnerable character that since its first appearance we know to be, to be (again) another piece in the limitless puzzle of this universe.

Thus, Marvel continues to miss the potential of a commitment to unveiling the tools it has by now mastered, preferring to use them superficially to attract the attention of the audience and then, just giving them more of what they already know and are ready to accept. The elongated flashback of the penultimate episode shows so obviously this, illustrating the story that we already know without experimenting with the meta-structure explored until the middle of the series. And the last episode is the typical third act of any of the twenty and three previous movies, where the clever use of television setbacks gives way to unmeasured visual effects. Still, the series beginning pulled out some of my most sincere smiles of recent times. Perhaps in a parallel universe, we could have received the definitive result of what was proposed to us."
9 March 2021,If you are looking for a hero...,,
16 January 2021,"Not funny at all, not even once.",3.0,"The term 'sit-com' means situation comedy, right? They go to great lengths to steal everything from 60's shows. One thing they forgot; how to be: FUNNY. Don't care how clever it thinks it is...how it's building into something; if the laugh ain't there, it's a bomb."
29 January 2021,Perfect!!!,9.0,Excellent! It is one of the best superhero series. Has the perfect combination of suspense and comedy
6 March 2021,LOVED IT!,10.0,
2 April 2021,Very slow and waste of time and plot,1.0,"Over hyped, just made for minting momey out of marvel brand."
17 January 2021,Pure Cashgrab,1.0,I cannot believe this is Marvel. this is totally unoriginal . Its a clear failed cash grab. The wanda and vision storyline had so much potential and they did this stupidity.
11 August 2021,Marvel outdid themselves on this one,9.0,"This is what makes us fall in love with the mcu , the creativity is unfathomable . Gave Wanda a 9 because It brought creativity , humour and an amazing story on the table, with all that managing to give us the perfect antagonist in this case . Unarguably one of the best miniseries I've ever watched."
6 March 2021,Really nice and new mcu story! But only in the beginning,6.0,"I was really happy with this series during the first episode. I was feeling like Marvel Studios was experimental with this but with every new episode after the 5th, the series got worse and worse (except for ep8) to arrive at the last episode that is so disappointing for me... it's really like Game of thrones that was amazing until the last season."
11 October 2022,"Started out promising, gradually became marvel phase 4",2.0,"The first three or so episodes of this show are pretty solid. This show does a pretty perfect job of mimicking these old sitcoms and there is a genuine feeling of mystery and uneasiness. But once it starts to show outside of the town it becomes so much worse so fast. None of the characters are entertaining or funny when they try so hard to be, and the plot becomes incredibly boring. But the last few episodes of this show are so absolutely terrible that a 2/10 is warranted, despite how much better the rest of the episodes are. What started as this down-to-earth, personal story about grief becomes a dumb marvel CGI fever dream. The show tries to redeem Wanda despite the fact that she held an entire town hostage for months, even showing that they feel pain while this is happening. It falls into the common superhero trope of the villain being a palate-swapped version of the hero, although this might be the most egregious example of it. One of the villains is another witch, but the other is literally Vision but white and blue instead of pink and green. This show isn't worth your time, even if the first few episodes are decent."
31 January 2021,To the idiot who said do people not realise it's supposed to be like old sitcom tropes,1.0,"People DO realise its sitcom. I know, surprising to you. And thats precisely why people are giving bad reviews. You personally enjoying it does not change the fact that many do not like it. Learn to be less of a bigot"
3 February 2021,2 episodes and I'm hooked,10.0,"This is amazing. The 50s sitcom of the first two episodes were such a trip, the acting was based on those times' and the cast did an amazing job without going Mid-atlantic crazy. Pure entertainment."
5 March 2021,A great show with an average finale,9.0,"I like the concept of the show and the way it was executed. First two episodes are there to pay tribute to the classic sitcoms and setting the tone of the series. At first the initial episodes seems pointless from the story progression point of view. But as the series progresses we understand why those episodes are important. The real deal starts at episode 4, with we getting some idea about what is going on. Episode 4 may be one of the best episode of the series. Episodes 5 & 6 are great and keeps your interest intact along with answering some of the questions. For me episode 7 is the weakest of all if you keep the big reveal aside. Episode 8 is one of the strongest episode and episode 9 is kind of let down for me. Acting : One of the strongest aspects of this series apart from the script is the performances by the actors. Specially Elisabeth Olsen and Catherine Hahn. They are phenomenal. Olsen showed her range in this series and this might land her an Emmy. The special effects are a bit off for me in few scenes if you compare it with MCU movies but majorly they are top notch."
19 July 2021,Best story I have EVER seen or read in my life - No Spoilers,10.0,I have read thousands of comic books and thousands of books in my life. Thousands!!! This story is the single BEST story I've had the pleasure of experiencing in my entire life. You haven't lived a full life if you don't watch it. I really mean this from the bottom of my heart. No story has EVER moved me like this!!!
16 March 2021,A crappy show,1.0,This is the definition of crappy show. 100% predictable and copy paste from Harry Potter.
27 January 2021,Amazing show! Something actually new on television!,10.0,The show begins super light hearted playing off different tropes of television's past. Then as the mystery begins the show really takes off. It's so great to see something different than the usual copy and paste television shows.
4 March 2021,Don't waste your time.,1.0,"Seriously the dumbest show on TV... ever. Not funny, not interesting, not entertaining. Nothing. Just a waste of good talented actors with very bad agents."
7 June 2022,Below Average,4.0,"Immediately following the events of the blip, if you haven't seen all the big avengers marvel movies leading up to this series, you should probably watch those first. I didn't. However I got most of it from context, this series certainly does not hold your hand for filling in its plot. There are of course twists, most of which were heavily implied quite early and were fairly predictable, and some which were just bizarre and felt forced part way through the (very short, 9 episode) series. I appreciated the many references to TV (at one point a small DVD collection is shown and I'm proud to say on freeze frame I was personally only missing one of them from my own collection), but at the end it really felt like more like a narrative gimmick than it did any sort of love letter to television or a meaningful plot device. Honestly I was very disappointed in this series as a whole, it has some characters commit atrocious acts, references how horrible they are, and then seemingly moves on with its day. Something that worked for the comics it was originally printed in and perhaps superhero series of before, but not the kind of plot laziness I expected for something this high budget in the MCU in 2021."
12 February 2021,WOW WOW WOW,10.0,I've never ever watched a show better than this Seriously I'm speechless
26 February 2021,Stick with it,8.0,First episode was Ropey so I didn't bother then episode five came out was told to give it another go. So I did. Just finished episode 8 and all my questions answered. Bravo marvel
17 January 2021,Enjoyed the Credits More,2.0,"The credits are the longest I have ever seen. This appears to be the problem with this show. Too many hangers on and not enough original content. This show so far is a weak copy of the ""Honeymooners"" and ""Bewitched"". If you are going to make a parody it has to be better, smarter, contain some originality. This fails. If you are sick of all the commercials on TV then this is just a little better."
15 January 2021,This is not Marvel,1.0,To very powerful super heroes turned into a comical parody. Seen far better Marvel tv shows that were brilliant but scrapped please dont run for another season
13 August 2021,"Not perfect, but almost.",9.0,"How many times have you watched Wandavision?

Cons: seven minutes of credits per episode and some questionable morality

Pros: everything else. Honestly this may be the most finely edited show I can think of. So much seems to happen in some episodes that it's wild how well it flows.

By the way. My friend adored it and she hates superhero stuff. Good stuff."
16 January 2021,Horrible,3.0,Not sure what they are doing with this but what a terrible plot
19 January 2021,Not worth it...,1.0,"I think the twist they gave to the series is not the right one. After seeing two of the MCU's most powerful characters who fought and gave their all for everything ... put them in a hackneyed comedy. It is a lack of respect. As someone said ""if I wanted to see I Dream of Jeannie or Bewitched"", I would. It's like watching Rambo doing comedy alongside Freddy Krueger. So boooooo Disney !!!"
22 February 2021,Please Stand by...and continue watching,9.0,"So, yes I am on the side of WandaVision (WV) being a brilliant TV series. For it has everything I always thought marvel films needed. WV starts off with 3 episodes that many have critiqued for being too slow and lacking a plot, something that I can definitely understand. But personally the mystery and confusion paired with beautiful costumes, set and direction. Create something completely unique to the MCU. WV is a show that pays off for looking into the details, yet for those that do not want to, it gives free explanation to, you just have to wait a little. If you have just started watching it and are bored of the unique first few episodes, get ready. Because if you continue, some crazy things start to happen in traditional MCU style. So yes, WV is an amazing show filled with things we have not been able to see in the MCU before because of strict film time-frames. It lets us glimpse with depth into lives that we might never have got to experience. Overall, do not give up and please watch it, after all its not just ""For the Children""."
17 March 2021,wanadavision,7.0,Season 1: everyone was obsessed with this so i watched it and tbh i think it was because i wasn't really focused on the show but for me it started to get really good like everyone else said near the last 2 episodes. everything else wasn't bad but i guess i just wasn't in the mood and it took out from my experience. it was good tho. now i can't wait for the falcon and the winter solider cuz bucky plz
16 January 2021,"The Amazing, spectacular, fabulous, fantastic",10.0,
30 January 2021,For those who rated 1 to 2 stars after the 2nd episode - feel free to update your rating and review.,10.0,"For those who were quick to rate 1 star after the 2nd episode and say they are ""huge marvel fans"" obviously don't know Wanda's back story. This is a creative depiction of an alternate reality. Kudos Disney, really looking forward to the rest of the season!"
17 January 2021,Waste of time trying to make feel happy HQ FANBOYS,2.0,"I can't believe they wasted AN ENTIRE EPISODE on this boring mess of an introduction.

Don't get me wrong, retro sitcoms can be very funny, but this was a completely cheeseball, pointless waste of time. They could have established a sinsiter mystery veiled by an idyllic sitcom in ten minutes, not wasted TWO ENTIRES EPISODES. A boring, boring episode with the flimsiest of narrative weight.

Honestly, I think the writers and producers should feel absolutely ashamed."
18 April 2022,Marvel all along..,7.0,"Nothing new, the same pueril boring awkward talking and little action that Marvel has got us used to. The idea was not bad, but it was exposed badly, too many episodes, many things unnecessary. Such as Agatha too, who was not comic accurate imo. Yes she is younger, but they could make her like in the X men Evolution, old, wise, serious and overpowered,but that's me, I only watched it because I wanted to know if it will be related to the next movie Wanda will appear in. Waste of time mostly, but it was good to see some attractive women, wink wink. Peace!"
13 July 2021,Amazing,10.0,It was really fun to watch and it got more interesting episode by episode. Every week I was eagerly waiting for a new episode of Wandavison to watch because of how engaging it was.
16 January 2021,From the heights of the netflix marvel shows,1.0,"Which were, you know, actually about stuff. Had strong interesting themes. Characters. Especially I'd mention JJ and Luke Cage's first seasons, and the final DD season. Exceptional.

Down to this corporate nonsense.

Seems like it was entirely planned by some self absorbed executives that hired one focus group after another until they (probably after many tries) found enough people still pining for Father Knows Best or the Andy Griffith Show. I'd mention The Honeymooners, but that was far better than this."
5 March 2021,One of my favourite MCU watches,10.0,Ignore any bad reviews you see from the first 2 episodes. They have greater meaning later on. This is truly one of the best things the MCU has come up with. I enjoyed every moment and the last episode is incredible. The storyline is not anything anybody had predicted and it left me in tears by the end. Truly emotional and makes you love Wanda as a character even more. I recommend this to everyone. Start watching the avengers now if you haven't!!!
21 February 2021,AMAZING 11/10,10.0,I'd give the show an 11/10 if I could. The twists just keep coming week after week. I'm so hooked! Definitely the show of the year! Emmys for everyone involved! The acting is SPECTACULAR
19 September 2021,Surprisingly Delightful,9.0,"This show took me by surprise. It was the Marvel TV series I was looking forward to the least and now I'm obsessed with it. It is an amazing and emotionally powerful story about grief, and perfectly encapsulates why Marvel content is more than just a ""superhero movie"". These characters aren't just superheroes, they are flawed humans with incredible powers who take the phrase 'with great power comes great responsibility' to the next level. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany give Emmy worthy performances. So happy they decided to make a TV series staring these incredible characters, it lets the creators dive deeper into character development, and lets the audience connect with characters more. This show made me care for Wanda like no movie ever could. The negative reviews mostly come from fanatics who are mad their theories didn't pan out and mad the show didn't give them things they were never promised in the first place."
18 May 2021,What is grief if not love persevering,9.0,"So firstly, let me start by saying I'm not the biggest Marvel fan.

But after watching it I soon caught up on Wanda/Vision/Scarlet Witch's history/backstory as it's an excellent slice of TV.

At its beating heart is a wonderful performance by Elizabeth Olsen, she shines as a woman wracked with the loss of the love of her life. (As seen in Avengers Endgame).

WandaVision perfectly portrays what we all go through at some point in our life -grief.

Paul Bettany as Vision is also excellent and carries what for me is and delivers the line of the series with ""what is grief if not love preserving"" Loss indeed hurts. A lot.

It may be a slow start for some, but for me I loved the first half of the series a lot. It's a perfect blend of comedy and at times 'The Twilight Zone'.

If I had one criticism it would be that for me the last episode felt very 'Marvel' and loose ends were tied together a little too quickly. (Another thing we can blame Covid on lol).

But don't let that put you off, this is a brilliant series and well worth anyone's time especially I think older folk like me haha

And finally, a big special mention to Kathryn Hann, she steals every single scene she's in as the nosey neighbour (she even gets her own theme tune that even after multiple views really makes me laugh)

So yes, now I am somewhat a bit of a Marvel fan.

WandaVision is superb."
19 January 2021,Worst MARVEL ANYTHING EVER,1.0,Dumbest parody of Bewitch!!! Dumb fake laughing stupid stupid premise!! Makes me cringe EVERYTIME I watched!!! WOW HOW COULD YOU WRITE SOMETHING SO BAD? I knew you people in Hollywood had no imagination but now I know you have one but it is just BAD! I don't care how many Easter eggs are in this show I can't SIT THROUGH IT!!! THE FIRST TWO EPISODES ANYWAYS!!! HIRRIBLE
15 January 2021,Finally...marvel has new content!,10.0,
5 March 2021,I want more comedy,7.0,
19 March 2021,Pretty terrible stuff,3.0,"It's typical Marvel nonsense, but even worse than it often is. Bettany, and especially Olsen, give very good performances, but that's about all it has going for it. It's filled with random, annoying characters. The female with glasses from Thor 2 is featured extensively here, and she's completely hateful. The actress that plays her is aggravating to put it lightly. The only white male (aside from Vision, who's actually a bright pink robot) in the show is the evil villain, so the show's offensive as well. I only stuck with the first 7 episodes because I was watching them with a family member, and I had to force myself to watch the last two. Don't waste your time."
15 January 2021,Magnificent!,10.0,"I did not know what to expect with the first of many new Marvel tv shows, but it was so good. I loved how the producers/writers were able to give the first two episodes that tv show feel from the 50's and 60's. I am intrigued where it's heading, but, unlike my usual self, am willing to wait this out and not look for spoilers. My only concern is that if this, and other shows are tying into the next Dr. Strange movie, I don't want to wait until next year. Fingers crossed it stays this good, or gets better!"
5 March 2021,May have suffered from being released weekly,5.0,
30 January 2021,Wait for it,10.0,Episode 4 is simply outstanding.. Waiting for the upcoming episodes
15 January 2021,Terrible F,7.0,No setup context. The show just jumps into 1950s sitcom style that will do nothing but confuse anyone who is under 50 years old Starting the series in this way will most likely frustrate anyone who was more interested in getting to see more Avengers Very dissatisfied.
30 January 2021,What was that all about????????,1.0,"There is an art to telling a story, and you need to hook your viewer/reader from the beginning, I wonder how many people will turn off or not return after episode one? and then the credits!!!! hollywood used to make films with casts of thousands, now its with crews of thousands. Come on Disney you used to make great entertainment once."
23 January 2021,Episode 3 review,10.0,
16 January 2021,Garbage,8.0,Could be not believe how bad it was first MCU series on Disney + I was expecting something incredible following the incredible series of films the MCU have done. After 2 episodes it was incredibly boring I did get the references but even that wasn't justified to what we got. Most people giving high ratings only doing so because it's marvel I'll rate it due to its quality
16 January 2021,a perfect start for the MCU tv mini series,10.0,First I thought it was sitcom and it would be boring but after see ing the episodes I was wrong they impressed me. I wonder why people are giving negative reviews by seeing just first two episodes
18 January 2021,My son didn't like it,4.0,"The MCU needs to relatable to adult and older children alike. My son did not like this show. I explained to him how the 50s sitcoms had a laugh track play after every joke, but this did not make him appreciate WandaVision. The jokes fell flat for me, too. With so many other shows on streaming which we can spend time watching, WandaVision needed to grab me from the very first episode. It didn't."
6 March 2021,A masterpiece from start to finish,10.0,"In a world where TV is produced based on viewer algorithms, how refreshing it is to see SUCH an original concept.

I'm not a fan of modern superhero movies that depend so much on dodgy CGI but this has plenty of soul and a lot of fun.

Very impressive how the acting, sets, costumes and dialogue adapt throughout the decades.

Not only is the storyline well thought out, but the pace and delivery is perfect.

As with any good TV series, it only becomes whole with the final episode.

One for the ages."
25 January 2021,I like it as for now,10.0,"It starts strange because I am not used to those old style sitcoms, but I am sure it will take a turn and surprise us. Im kinda thrilled"
15 January 2021,Apart from the first 3 episodes it's a nice series,7.0,I didn't like the first 2 episodes. They were dull and the jokes absolutely didn't work for me. Couldn't believe why others in IMDb are praising these two episodes. I would have slept for an hour if not for the fast forward option. Don't really understand why this show was created. I'm watching this only because it connects to Dr. Strange 2. Otherwise would have skipped this. There's no hope that the coming episodes will be good. Well they all say there's only one way when you have it rock bottom. Up. Edit: The story starts from 4th episode and it's interesting. Makes you wonder why the hell they made the first 3 episodes when they could have started right from 4th episode.
16 January 2021,a great start that some don't appreciate.,10.0,"Wandavision is by far one of the most innovative things in marvel studios. wandavision gives us what the advances promised us, the superhero series should not always be about fights. I see many people complaining about how slow the series is and that the comedy is awful. I do not agree I think that as viewers we should be open to seeing new ideas, wandavision is not a bad product, but rather a product that you should appreciate."
26 January 2021,Slow but intriguing,8.0,"While the first two episodes are slow, Marvel Studios was able to make me stay interested in this show since Episode 3 was released. I'm excited to see what Episode 4 has to offer!



To those who thought this was going to be action-packed from the start;

You people should pay more attention to when it was announced. Kevin literally announced that this is going to be a ""sitcom gone wrong"".

And to those who watched this show just Because they crave for more MCU action;

Be patient and wait for TFATWS."
23 February 2021,Even worse after 5 episodes.,1.0,Started watching because I thought E Olsen was pretty. Now I just think she is mediocre.
28 February 2021,Starts off slow but the mystery builds,9.0,
23 January 2021,Just Trash,1.0,Who ever isn't losing their job over this trash is inexcusable. Why would they ruin two great marvel characters with this poorly done series?
23 January 2021,What a boring mess..,1.0,Don't waste your time on this 50's boring mess.. Where people off screen laugh for no reason.. Like it's a drama.. Very annoying.. Dissappointed.. How can any channel approve this?
16 January 2021,This 60's child is enamored,8.0,"Only 2 episodes in, I'm loving this satirical take on the sitcoms I watched as a child. Very good and more importantly funny as well.

1st episode- Tribute to I Love Lucy 2nd episode- Tribute to Bewitched.

Can't wait to see where this goes!!!!"
17 January 2021,Acid Trip,2.0,This takes me back when there were only three networks and you were force to watch tripe like I Love Lucy or Petticoat Junction. I felt like a hostage watching this cringy show. It took me back to a time where TV sitcoms ruled the airways. Unfortunately they were bland and not funny. I hope this gets better. I will stick around for the third episode but if it doesn't get better I will bury it in the old sitcom graveyard.
16 January 2021,"Sorry, no.",7.0,"This is star wars holiday special all over again. No. I ain't watching this train wreck.

Edit after 2 years So yeah, sorry about being an idiot. It turned out to be not as bad as I thought. Some bits were actually cool and I admit I have enjoyed the show from episode 3 or 4 onwards."
19 October 2023,They should just make a 45 minute TV movie,3.0,"This is a show that follows the Infinity War event, and basically, I quite like the idea of this show, but the presentation of the 9 eps did not meet expectations. The story is told after Wanda leaves Tony's funeral, and ends when she decides to hide at a lake near a snowy mountain. Nothing changes. I feel like Wanda just went from Tony's house straight to the lake, and on the way she picked up the witch book. End. 9 episodes have been about Wanda's imagination and how Sword responds... The CGI is quite good, the music is also good. But every character in this is presented in a ""safe zone"", playing the role of a friendly neighbor and the story drifts between comedy and a bit of mystery with the aim of making the viewer fooled, but in the end they only create confusion and discomfort. Peter of the X-men universe is just a cameo character for the purpose of attracting attention, there's really nothing else to say about him. It seems Marvel is creating a superhero universe ""for the family"" instead of a world of people with special abilities, special and rough emotions. Unfortunately, that is exactly what viewers want. And even with this interesting idea, WandaVision still has many silly, unnatural details, outdated and predictable development scenes, and the story does not create surprises or attractions, but just like a story of an ironic advertisement."
16 January 2021,Bewitched / I Love Lucy Parody,2.0,
3 April 2021,Can't,1.0,Giving it a 1 because not going to pay for another streaming service.
17 May 2021,beautiful,8.0,"Some people does not understand the porpouse of the first episodes, and thats sad because this tv series is a beutiful homenage to the television history, sadly, the last 2 episodes feels like a generic superhero movie."
15 January 2021,"Whoever wrote the negative reviews ,they are the REAL MARVEL HATERS",8.0,"Wow ,WOW!

Just imagine this greatness in the first 2 episodes only ,so what about the rest of the episode!?

I can't wait ANOTHER WHOLE WEEK for another episode.

Everything is perfect ,especially the acting of all the cast ,Elizabeth and Paul are shining in the screen.

Unlike anything we have ever seen.

WOW"
15 January 2021,unique and interesting,10.0,"It starts off slow but i still really enjoyed it and it's definitely gonna get better as it goes on. The corny sitcom humor and dialogue really fits well and i'm not a huge fan of sitcoms so i was surprised that it was this good. Throughout the episodes more weird stuff happen that reminds me of a twilight episode, and it keeps everyone asking questions. And i keep seeing reviews like ""marvel fanboys are giving it a 10/10 even though we've only seen 2 episodes"" even though they are giving it a 1/10 when we've only seen 2 episodes."
15 January 2021,Unprecedented and Ominous,10.0,"I really don't understand why many people are giving this show a rating of 1 star in reference to the old-timey aesthetic ""not-working."" They do realize the aesthetic is an illusion and mystery for what's to come right.

Marvel's unprecedented direction with this show is amazing and deserves recognition. Elizabeth Olson and Paul Bettany in particular are so dynamic even in the first two episodes! You can tell Paul is having a fun time with the humorous aspects of this role!"
16 January 2021,Absolute Rubbish,2.0,How is this rated an 8? It's just corny and not good.
15 May 2022,Boring...but Agatha Harkness was great,5.0,"I know Wanda's story. I read the ""House of M"" comic book series. It's an amazing series that explains the level of Wanda's true powers as being one if not the most powerful mutant.

This sitcom/series, nonsense Disney pumped out is cash grab garbage that has nothing at all to do with the ""The Scarlett Witch"" aka Magneto's daughter. How can they miss so much on the mark about a character that has such an interesting story to make something this corny and boring?

I really only enjoyed Agatha Harkness. She was the saving grace of this series but she seemed rather underused. The only interesting episodes are the ones with her in them. For someone that was supposed to be a fun and sinister villain they could have used her more but she actually was a minor character in the overall plot of this series.

But lets be honest the MCU version of the Scarlett Witch is rather boring in general. A boring character with a boring series. I'm sure some will enjoy this but I doubt their comic fans.

Also if you were expecting anything close to the House of M story line with Wanda's true powers revealed think again. She is still nerfed by the MCU."
19 February 2021,BE AFRAID!,10.0,"Don't let the music manipulate you...this is a Horror/Thriller! It's down right creepy and it's the first taste of a scarier MCU! I religiously count the days to the next episode! Every bit of information given is more and more mysterious and damning!

Whatever the hell this show is, it is a glimpse into the next phase of the MCU! The jokes can be funny, don't laugh! This is just as scary as the blip! The snap that started the events of this show is now just a single piece of the overall puzzle! Please bring back the real Quicksilver, introduce the Mutants, and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! Please God!!! Do Mojovision (if that isn't already going on...) and PLEASE GOD do ""THE BROOD SAGA""!!!

Please!!! I also highly recommend! I'm a sucker for Marvel stuff 10 out of 10!!!"
15 January 2021,Love it!!,10.0,"Love this....it's so different. Lots of Easter eggs!!

And be patient.......it's building up to something!!"
21 May 2021,AWESOME!,10.0,"This series is definitely not for everybody. Some people gave this low rating because they are probably expecting ""The Avengers"" type of action scenes which I think is pretty dumb and stupid. Only people who loves a real story and character development would appreciate this. And I do. This series is basically about how Wanda confronted her past to fix her future. I almost cried at the last episode because I felt what she's been through. It was a tragic love story. I loved Wanda when she appeared in Avengers: Age of Ultron and I loved her even more after watching this series. Elizabeth Olsen is definitely a talent.

PS: If you are reading my review & haven't seen this yet. If you are looking for action-packed episodes please skip this and move on with your life. This show does not deserve another stupid reviews."
10 April 2021,To be honest,6.0,"Have to say that expectations were way better than reality.

This was norm. 6/10 cause of respect to marvel won't say any negative things."
1 February 2023,Irredeemably bad in every respect,1.0,"To make a sitcom that's actually funny you need to have both a good script and actors who know how to be funny - neither of which is present in this show.

The script is unimaginably boring and predictable. The jokes don't land and the pre-recorded laughter does not help resolve this awkward situation.

Sadly, the acting is also far below average. These same actors do quite well in normal movies, but in a setting like this they just appear contrived, forced and fake. There is nothing genuine about the delivery, which also ruins any fun each attempted joke could've delivered.

The show also can't seem to decide whether it wants to be in black and white or film grain and whatever other irrational video filter they've randomly apply for each episode.

All in all, this one is best of avoided, in my opinion, as it is a complete waste of time.

I can't find a single good reason to watch this so it gets a rare 1 star out of 10 from me."
17 January 2021,Stop!,10.0,Repeat after me... I will stop reviewing this series thinking i've watched the whole thing. You have not watched it all so stop and watch the rest or at least change your review if you like it in the end. This is how shows that are actually really good get cancelled too early. I'm rating this a 10 to make up for all the people rating 1 after seeing two episodes.
4 March 2021,WandaVison is what everyone needed for 2021,10.0,"Such a great way to bring us into the new year and phase of MCU. Wandas and Visons characters needed this show, it is very necessary. Btw what is grief without love persevering 💔💔💔💔LOLLL"
2 April 2021,Being real,2.0,Wanted to love this because I love the MCU but I have to be real. Was going to give it a 5 but after seeing how many bs 9 and 10s there are I couldn't do it. I love the mcu but don't have feel like I have to give a false rating to be a fan. The acting especially in the first 3 episodes was horrible. Casting is everything and I could have gave this a 6 if cathryn hahn was believable In the role. She was as badly cast as Kristen wig in ww2. That's the truth.
6 March 2021,After the 8th episode...,6.0,"I saw the 1st & 2nd episode and then skipped to the 8th & 9th. A nice love story with super witches and super powered androids. Marvel would be great withOUT the love stories but whom I to say?

A 6 for great affects and twists in the plot. That is where is all stops."
9 September 2023,Below my expectations. No match for Bojack Horseman in what it tries to achieve. Doesn't deserve the hype. Lacks a lot in fine tuning.,6.0,"Apparently, I've been late for the party. I just started watching this yesterday, excited and willing to go along with the premise. By the 6th episode, I'm kinda done. Who knows, I may someday finish it but really do not feel the need to go any further before dropping this criticism here.

First of all: I'm quite well-versed in the Marvel Universe. Though some plot lines have gotten foggy with time, I remember well the origins of that storyline. And I'm pretty sure they have incorporated John Byrne's story on how Dr. Doom made the Fantastic Four live in such a realm outside their own free will. Hardcore buffs will get better what I mean, but yes, the spirit of this show is based deep in the Marvel Comics of the 60s, 70s, 80s. And I appreciate that.

BUT... And that's a big but... Kevin Feige has used this gem solely on a ""visual"" manner, ironically. WandaVision's tributes to TV shows of each era should and could well have been GREAT examples of what people were doing back then. But no, they aren't. No real humor to make us laugh WITHIN those borders.

I strongly believe that, what they had on mind was to carry this to the level of Bojack Horseman. ""Once in the 90s I was in a very famous TV show"", yeah... And when we see clips from / references to THAT show in the actual Bojack series, the humor does hold water. It's not like they were solely interested in ridiculing past entertainers. They DID have sympathy and respect for them.

With WandaVision, I don't see that. Wanda must have been a terrible judge of quality to establish her realm, because what she presents on air is far from being the best of what 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s gave the audiences.

This show could have gone way above the usual Marvel target audiences had they given more thought on the potential and woerked harder and better on the inside jokes.

The first two episodes could have the power points of Bewitched WHILE serving the storyline. They just don't. And later on, we get to have a taste of 70s and 80s TV only on a visual level. Those shows were never as lame or insignificant as how Wanda references them to be.

I think they have violated a major rule while doing this one: Never get into a territory you don't truly appreciate! With Bojack Horseman, it's obvious that the people backstage have grown up with 90s sitcoms, so they have a say on the whole culture on multiple layers, personal memories to throw it, appreciation whatnot...

But with WandaVision, no... A big NO... The main focus they have chosen to go with is not rich in details... Wanda's episodes are not things we would have cared about had they been stand alone productions.

But well, it seems they managed to create the hype they seeked for, even without succeeding in what was quite possible. So, WandaVision will be remembered as a ""cool show"" by those who are okay with the skin deep treatment to that major line of homages.

And that's kinda sad."
6 March 2021,Review,10.0,Best marvel series must watch series if you watch u will become big fan of wanda
5 February 2021,Picking up,10.0,"So far it's been a Rollercoaster, that keeps going up. One of the best shows I've ever seen! Can't wait to see how it ends."
19 January 2021,Dire,1.0,Watched the first two episodes. But halfway through the second one it became too much. It's a poor ripoff of some of the classic 1960's shows like Bewitched with canned laughter. This may be leading to something better but I'll not be waiting around to find out. Marvel what on earth were you thinking.
9 March 2021,Good...but,6.0,It's an interesting start which leaves you wondering as it progresses it really is good. One thing that is highly irritating. There's no need for 8 minutes of ending credits
16 January 2021,Hmmm. I'm missing something.,2.0,I watched the 1st 2 episodes like everyone else and I was bored. I fell asleep on both of them. Maybe I just hoped for some MCU action and got nothing so this seemed like a dud. Come on MCU and get this thing cranked up!!!
5 March 2021,MILD SPOILER it shows what the future of marvel will be,10.0,This show is very different from any thing marvel has ever done and that's why I love it. it takes characters that were nobody's favourite and instantly turns them into fan favourite it also had side characters that nobody cared about from other MCU movies and turns them into main characters that everybody loves. This is the wanda I have been waiting for the full power scarlet witch thats all im gonna say
15 January 2021,Disappointing,5.0,The reviews here are Overhyped and the show is strictly okay bcuz of its boring screenplay but bad humor also but the 2nd ep has some laughing moment thats it. Elizabeth stole the show which is the only positive aspect and reason of me giving 5 stars but as a sitcom also its boring. If u can just avoid and wait for falcon and winter soldier
6 February 2021,Best series,10.0,Wanadavison first 2 episode was not good but from 3rd episode marvel is back best ever seen tv series must watch for very marvel fan
23 January 2021,"dreadful, slow and unfunny",1.0,Managed to get to halfway through second episode and gave up.. utterly dreadful One of the worst shows I have ever viewed. Far too slow
20 January 2021,Finally Marvel being bold,10.0,"Just from the first 5 minutes you can tell that this is way different from what Marvel usually comes out with. But even the show knows that and it has no problems going its own direction. Its refreshing, bold, creative and I want more."
11 March 2021,Best Marvel TV show and better then the movies in my opinion.,10.0,Best Marvel TV show and better then the movies in my opinion. Staring with some interesting new kind of story telling. Remind me more of the comic and makes me super excited. For people that don't get it in the beginning. Stay tuned. Bold and the right way too go if you want the fans of marvel too really follow in too the new era. Loved the ending as it was not really expected... No spoilers. Can't wait for more. Please make more of this and don't fall for the same old high action no intressting story telling like some other marvel shows has.
16 January 2021,Not sure where they are headed with this,3.0,"I don't like the 25 minute episodes that have pointless plots. After a year of hype I expected to be hooked right away. Instead, we get a weird version of Bewitched and barely a tie-in to the MCU. Maybe I am too impatient, but I lost interest in this already."
5 March 2021,Over The Top FX For Coping With Loss,4.0,"WanderVision is a perfect example of an overrated show made for its hardcore Marvel fanbase. It's a story of coping with the loss of a loved one. It's not a terrible show, but it's definitely not got the greatest either. It has a very slow start and is fairly predictable. The last episode goes down pretty much how you expect, and is obviously where all the money was spent for the visual effects. Fans of Marvel will love this show."
30 January 2021,Mixed Emotions,8.0,"E1 - WTF is that...is it Marvels Avengers story or 60's TV show....broken dreams...total failure... 1/10 E2 - Although 60's 70's TV show theme continues, there are some suspicious and promising points...lets wait for the next episode...2/10 E3 - Wait somethings definitely going on and story line changing...6/10 E4 - oHH...it was worth the wait until 4th episode...The show definitely a Marvels Avengers one. Its hard to wait until next episode....8/10"
17 July 2021,Good but a bit boring,7.0,Story is good . Initially it was a bit boring but after episode 4 it became interesting. Ending is awesome .
21 January 2021,Ratings are based off the HOPE if it getting better,5.0,"The reality now, is that these two episodes are boring as heck and to score it higher would mean offering credit and I am not a bank!"
15 June 2022,It's ok but drags,5.0,
30 January 2021,"Super well written, acted and original",10.0,Dear God all those people that rated this a 1 just because the first episode is in black and white are dumber than Jar Jar Binks.... I have nothing else to say.
30 January 2021,From predictable to annoying,1.0,Must every series have at least one annoying f ? Who the f thought Kat Dennings would be a good idea ? Fire that f .
21 February 2021,Amazing,10.0,"I *HARDLY* get this excited about a TV show.. WandaVision is so much more than just a TV show, it's an experience. I'm constantly on the edge of my seat, if the rest of the upcoming MCU series' are this good, we're in for a treat. Good job Disney this show is EVERYTHING."
15 March 2021,Laugh tracks need to be gone,4.0,"Disney thought they could grab everyones attention week by week but they were wrong it should of been a full season drop then it would have been much better!

And laugh track was so unbearable they need to go all together!"
14 January 2022,I don't understand where that note comes from,6.0,"There are two options: either you like it or you really don't like it!

And I tried! I really tried. I watched five episodes and came to the same conclusion, as at the end of the first episode. It really is a mess. It's for those who watched TV in the 60's, a sitcom garbage. That's all! Noted with 3. I would have given 1 but I think I would have been unfair. But it is clearly a waste of time. I was waited for a real Marvel."
23 February 2021,YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS ( bear the first 3 eps),10.0,Cant wait for the rest ahhh !! So intriguing and unpredictable.makes the person viewing dig deep into the story line
17 January 2021,OMG!,9.0,I am sure most people are going to change their review after episode 4 and 5..
15 January 2022,Not really my cup of tea (mild spoiler),7.0,
1 February 2021,....but wait! There's more!,8.0,"Please contain yourself. See at least the 3 first episodes before making your mind up! It has subtle and not so subtle tidbits in the show and by the fourth, if it isn't tickling your interest... turn it off. But do see it until the credits! Or you might miss it..."
10 May 2022,what you want to convey is conveyed well,10.0,"Amazing plot twist of this movie allows the audience to enter the film and feel what the actor feels.

Nice plot presentation excellent timeline selection

this is one of the best films in the cinematic universe of wonders."
21 March 2021,I loved the whole series ( spoiler warning),10.0,"I loved the whole series the sitcom episodes were funny, I don't get why a lot of people didn't like the first 2 episodes I could've watched a whole series on that part. Episodes 4-5 were explaining what happened through the eyes of Jimmy Woo from Ant Man and the Wasp, Darcy Lewis from the Thor movies and a grownup Monica Rambau, the kid from Captain Marvel. Episode 8 showed us Wanda's past. And the finale was so exciting and emotional. Every episode left me wanting answers and I couldn't wait for the episode next week no other show has done that that's why this deserves 10 stars"
17 June 2022,Mommy Wanda,8.0,"Really interesting. Loved the whole concept of the story, it was really good. The only thing it lacked was a bit of action. The story was brilliant, and also mommy wanda."
5 May 2021,Good watch... Could have been better,5.0,
17 January 2021,Don't listen to 1 star reviews,10.0,"I really can't believe all the negative reviews! The first two episodes set up a much larger plot with a lot of suspense. I do agree that it probably would have been better to release the full season, but still, judging a concept before knowing where it goes is ridiculous. If you are worried, just wait until the whole season airs and watch it then. For the record, I am adding a 10 star rating to balance out all the so called ""fans"" who are disappointed because they don't understand how narrative development works."
16 January 2021,I don't get it,1.0,"Bizarre cheesy 1950s sitcom with the two main characters taken from MCU. If you love watching Bewitched then you will love this. If Avengers Endgame is your thing, you will be horrified. This is not action/adventure/sci-fi."
19 February 2021,Wandavision is FANTASTIC!,10.0,"Wandavision has become my new obsession. As a 40 yr old, I remember the excitement of Saturday morning cartoons. I now get that feeling early Friday morning. I have told anyone I know they have to watch it and the all say the same thing... they can't get past episode 2. I understand the black and white throw backs are difficult but it sets up for the remaining episodes. Wandavision is written incredibly well and it leaves you looking for clues in the simplest phrases or themes. Trust in Marvel."
5 February 2021,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10.0,"Indian audience was not able to connect with ep 1 and 2 but still they was awesome. Ep 3 and 4 was soooooo much surprising. I'm so excited for next episode. How can anyone give 9-8 star. Marvel's every single movie and show deserve 10 stars. They deserve man. It's isn't easy to bring 20-30 movie in same timeline. They are doing. They are best in it. Love you marvel, and love you Disney. For making such wonderful show and movie for us. I'm actually living for this show. There is no any other reason for me to live."
23 September 2021,Great,10.0,I'm surprised it only has 8 stars it is by far the best series and it was sooooo good.
21 April 2021,A great show,9.0,"Just finished watching Wandavision. It was a great show here is my ranking Episode 1: 6/10 Episode 2: 6/10 Episode 3: 7/10 Episode 4: 8/10 Episode 5: 8/10 Episode 6: 8/10 Episode 7: 9/10 Episode 8: 10/10 Episode 9: 10/10

Overall rating for the show is 9/10."
9 February 2021,Mind bending,10.0,"Awesome show, so many details.

Thank you Disney/Marvel for this."
21 April 2021,Loved It,10.0,"Seriously good! Loved this show, giving this a 10/10."
21 April 2021,Good ending and necessary for the MCU,8.0,"It's a very good show, I enjoyed it, but and there's a big but, the beginning of the show is pretty boring if you expect the classic marvel style. After episode 2 it starts to be interesting.. Nice development for a underestimated character."
17 February 2021,Predictable plot.,1.0,Nothing's new to watch. An ancient predictable plot. A very disappointing show in modern history.
6 February 2021,Review For WandaVison,10.0,"AMAZING this show is just the best Marvel show it's has twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. One thing that you must do before you watch this show is watch most of the Marvel movies including Captain Marvel, Avengers Age of Ultron and Captain America Civil War."
18 February 2021,"Great show so far, way too short episodes.",9.0,"I didn't know what to say or where to put this show after the first 3 episodes.

But after that...the whole thing turned upside down and I have to say this show is amazing imo!

The only downside of it is the lenght of the episodes. A net 21-22 minutes per episode is way too short imo compared to the weekly waiting time for the next episode. This was my main issue with the Mandalorian as well. So it seems like it is a ""Disney-thing""

Too short to build characters and for details. Too little time to get into the whole world and enjoy. The popcorn is barely done when the show is alredy gone. 😅

I personally like Netflix' giving it all at once model and like the average lenght of the their shows more...

Other than that, WandaVision managed to surprise me, which barely ever happens these days, as tons of cliche and poor quality shows all around.

WandaVision is really a good series! 9/10"
10 March 2021,Deffo worth the watch!,7.0,"Okay I'll be honest. The show itself is a slow burner to get into, the story overall is cracking, very imaginatively created, and well scripted. I feel like it could be more voilent, but I suppose that's how they've made it for a wider audience. I'm not completely blown away by the whole series, and am unsure how they can even make a second series without it being completely different to the first which is where the original creative magic came. Fear it could just turn into a 'what's Wanda up to now' kinda show if it carries on. Overall top marks for imagination and execution, half marks for grabbing me completely, so I give it a 7/10"
22 January 2021,This is unadulterated Art - The first 2 episodes are not a superficial watch.,7.0,"I watched the first 2 episodes on the release and was left progressively disappointed. I struggled to find it entertaining, and to be fair, it all just flew past me, but the suspense it created fired my curiosity. I didn't want to write it off. I felt I had missed something and it was my fault. I checked the reviews here and they were either high or low.. I couldn't quite believe the 10's but it didn't seem to warrant the 1's either - It seemed far too early to condemn it. You need the first 3 episodes before you can even begin to start judging it. You will need patience, attention and an awareness of the source material to fully appreciate the initial episodes as it's setting the scene for where it's going and apparently setting up the next phase of the MCU.

I bought the comics as a kid and I've enjoyed the film's but I wouldn't call myself a hardcore Marvel nut.

After doing some YouTubing on episodes 1 and 2 to try to understand more of what was possibly going on, I rewatched the first episodes and really started to admire and thoroughly enjoy what they have created. I couldn't believe how much skipped past me. It's very, very, very clever. It's next level.

I think it's art. All of it.. from the acting to the sets to everything. You'll either love it or hate it I guess, but don't let the first 2 episodes put you off. It's very unique. I watched the 3rd episode today.. as soon as I possibility could. It's definitely got me sold."
25 January 2021,One Episode Per Week is a load of Bushwah...,1.0,"I've been really looking forward to the show. Also, I have to admit that I haven't seen any of it yet. But I want to go on the record as saying a 1/2 hour per week format is a load of crap. This is particularly true given that it's a streaming platform. I don't know why they don't release the entire season all at once so I can watch at my own pace when I want to watch.

I really hope this is not going to be the standard for Marvel's streaming series."
5 March 2021,One of the Greatest Series Ever...,10.0,This is one of the top work of Marvel.. Again Marvel just nailed it....and Acting and directions are super....I really loved it....
31 March 2022,Did I watch a different show?,1.0,"Everyone I knew rated this tripe so highly?

Absolute nonsense from start to finish, playing more on the uninteresting, forced and under developed relationship between Wanda Nd Vision that got shoe horned down our mouths in between Avengers films off screen.

Marvel fans confuse fan service with good content once again. And the twist was awful, cringe and insulting to the viewer."
15 January 2021,If you love parody's watch this,1.0,"Clearly makes no sense, A deviation tactic to waste time in the episode, expected more from the Series and just because there's comedy, all things shouldn't be taken for a joke or granted, soon will end up more of a parody."
16 January 2021,What a gimmick,,"If you're going to tell a story tell a story, it's a cute gimmick but CHRIST what the hell was the point of these first episodes"
20 March 2021,AWESOME CAN'T WAIT TO DOCTOR STRANGE MULTIVERSE,10.0,I just love everything in this series and also i cry so much 😭
24 January 2021,People are missing the point! This show is so cool and unique,10.0,"Several reviews on here are saying ""ugh a sitcom so boring"" or ""not what I expected at all, terrible execution"" or even another one ""A sitcom!? so boring turned it off halfway through first episode"". But they are missing the point. if they had payed attention or given it a chance, they would see that there is more than what first meets the eye. Also, it is not a satire or trying to make fun of american sitcoms. rather, it is paying an homage to them. Accuracy from everything to the lighting, decor, outfits, character expressions/emotions, ect, were authentic to the time period. Not to mention those fun, episode/decade specific intros and creepy fake commercials in each episode too. Personally, I would rate the first episode 7.5-8 out of 10, the second episode a 8 out of 10, and the third 9 or 10 out of 10, because it really amps up the plot and you can start to see more about the world westview and overall plot.

Ps. I haven't watched any old sitcoms, but after 2 minutes of looking some up, I easily understood and appreciated a lot of the references in WandaVision."
10 May 2021,"Part comedy, part mystery, part sci-fi, all love story.",9.0,
15 January 2021,I'm rating the first 2 episodes,9.0,"Coming from a die hard, possibly, no not possibly THE biggest MCU fan in the universe, you may think my review is biased. However, I will be objective. The show is what was promised in the trailer. It's hilarious. Friendly, familiar faces and a deep undertone of mystery. The lovely couple have no idea how they got there, when they got there, and why they are there. You see Wanda struggle with that concept internally. Mysterious moments throughout the show provide the audience with ""woah what was that?"" I know for a fact everything will come together spectacularly by the season finale. For the skeptics, be patient, I know you're used to action packed battles, but this is different. Allow it to be"
17 May 2021,Marvels worst release to date,1.0,
15 January 2021,"It is good and it will be, but people do not let it grow.",9.0,"People who do not come with an open mind or are only fans of the action in the first chapter, will not enjoy it. But people who want to see something funny, horror, Wanda's psychology, bad vibes, mistery and well planned, will know that it's a good series. It must be said that many complaints that I see in the reviews are from people who do not understand how the series works and will work (or simply were not reported in recent months with trailers).

I found it entertaining, with a touch of mystery, easter eggs and terror that will surely unfold with the episodes. Please, do not pay attention to users who put less than 5 stars and that they only have ""sitcom"" or ""action"" as an excuse. (here in a few weeks they will cry when they realize that it is a good series).

It is told to you by someone who was afraid of the series and who has ended up loving it.

Sorry for my bad english."
7 February 2022,6.5/10 - If Only Marvel Could Not Hold Back From Time to Time,6.0,"The MCU has a problem. Well, it has more than one, but this one just took this series' promising start to a very medicore, MCU cliche direction.

The problem is, essentialy, that they can't truly go full power on a great, deep idea. It showed on Infinity War, now it shows here.

Wandavision is an MCU-related series that follows Wanda Maximoff and Vision in an odd sitcom of sorts. As weird things begin to occur, the mystery which is this weird sitcom is slowly unraveled. On the way there's a little dive into Wanda's psychology, her powers and her past.

So, like I said, the main issue here is Marvel holding back. I like a lot of things about the beginning of the series - the mystery aspect is quite thrilling, and it's very well done on the first couple of episodes. I like the writing, which is witty and entertaining, and I also really appreciate how the creators of Wandavision managed to capture so many vibes through every aspect of the sitcom. You'll get it when you'll watch it, if you haven't yet. Anyway, it works well, and I honestly like the premise of the show a lot. It also started in a way that made me think that here, Marvel can actually do stuff the way it should be done, and consistently.

Well, as you may realise by now, it didn't go on like that. Not really.

I can't go on full details here, but I'll try to communicate the idea in general: By incorporating unnecessary plotlines with underwritten characters and way-too-much-explainatory nature, the series has lost its mystery, and lost its decent pacing, actually. I'll also say that Wanda should've been confronted, mentally speaking, with something, and it didn't happen the way I think it should've happenned. She just kinda got off with it, and I feel like this is simply cause Marvel can't go full force on darker ideas, or more experimental (for the MCU, at least), direction. Which, again, is quite a shame.

So, yeah. WandaVision has some highlights, some really cool ideas, and a lot of things that we didn't see Marvel doing...well, maybe ever, at least in the MCU. Sadly, it slowly becomes more and more mediocre towards the end of the show, and so the whole experience isn't much more than ""well, that was...nice, I guess"". Feeling a 6.5/10 on this one."
20 May 2021,Brilliant,10.0,An absolute masterpiece for this particular character. Elizabeth olsen just brings this character to life (no pun intended)
16 January 2021,over rated,1.0,Being a marvel fan i am highly disappointed. 1) background laughter is annoying 2) irritating comedy 3) didn't get a laugh out even for a single second 4) 8 minutes of credit line at end of episode
29 March 2021,Poor storyline,1.0,
16 January 2021,The episodes are too short,7.0,"The first episodes are okay, but how long do they expect us to wait before knowing the premise? I'll be fine with just the sitcom aspect, but that's not Marvel. Action needs to come. Fast."
24 February 2021,No 01 Marvel TV Series,10.0,This TV series is a one of the best comic TV series of my favourite list. Every episode contains ton of Easter eggs.
16 January 2021,It's boring,1.0,"I am not sure about upcoming episodes but first 2 episodes are boring, but I likes Elizabeth Olsen she's looking so beautiful"
15 January 2021,What a great show a start of phase 4 its a really amazing show and exciting,10.0,What a great show a start of phase 4 and its good to have 2021 great marvel series
20 January 2021,Potential for Greatness or Not,7.0,
22 February 2021,Nope. Just nope.,1.0,"This, I watched the two first episodes, will also be the last I watch of this. To all that pclain it's artistic and it gets better - it's derivative. It's boring. Only hardcore fans will sit through this. It'll not draw the masses.

I'd rather binge I love Lucy than this yawnfest."
16 January 2021,Perfect mini series,10.0,"Superb show,I thought black and white background will make movie bore but it was worth watching."
7 February 2021,Masterpiece !,10.0,Marvels new masterpiece! Easy the best tv series for a superhero!
15 January 2021,Not what I expected,8.0,"I like the show , and we still got 7 episodes to watch , so iam rating the first two episodes, they are good but not great so iam hoping for the best"
15 January 2021,"Not your usual MCU fair, but worth sticking with",9.0,"The first things to remember about WandaVision is that this is a long form show and although each episode has a mini episodic story, it's all going somewhere bigger. The other thing I'd say is that it's a slow burn.

If you're expecting the typical MCU all action, solves all its problems by punching them story then you may be disappointed (well, maybe until the later episodes of the series). But, if you're looking for a story that gives two of the MCUs most tragically underused characters some room to breathe and for their characters and personalities to come out then you should enjoy this.

I would say some knowledge of the mid to late 20th century sitcoms are a help - I've seen so many angry comments about 'why are they overacting', 'why keep the same camera angle for so long', 'why isn't it widescreen', etc. - each episode is stylised, styled on a sitcom of a particular decade. In the first two episodes we have the Dick Van Dyke Show 50s (I know, DVDS was 1961+) and Bewitched 60s. And each of those sitcoms are lovingly emulated, in look, feel, effects, sound and writing. But, there're moments, small moments where the reality we're watching shifts, pointing to a bigger, darker story. I can't help but feel that it's going to end with a lot of action, vfx and tears. And I'm loving every moment."
25 January 2021,"Its not fun, its boring",3.0,"This is not a 60s. Not fun , boring, cheap jokes, i never laught on it. Bad retro unfashioned conversations, i dont really know who this series made for."
9 December 2021,Middle is amazing everything else is meh,7.0,"Overall enjoyable series but the 1st 3 episodes drag on and could have been shortened to 1 episode.

And the last several episodes are ok. This series is a bit overrated IMO."
17 September 2021,Interesting idea which goes down hill.,6.0,First couple of episodes were better while it was mostly just a kitschy sitcom. It was a harder slog getting through the last few episodes.
24 February 2021,Why I m watching this,3.0,Trust me if Marvel name didn't involve into it (characters) people don't even watch this show
15 January 2021,Trailer = Movie,1.0,"There was so many trailers before and before watching every new trailer i was thinking, maybe this will be good and will show that this TV show will not be so bad and boring, but it is. If you think its comedy than you dont have sense of humor. Nothing funny, no adventure, no action, no story line and any way... if at the end of season there will be some breaking changes and story what will connect to the movies or smth... it changes nothig. Waste of time!!!!!"
29 January 2021,Really great. 10/10,10.0,"Just great. First two episodes start it slow, episode 3 picks up the pace, and by episode 4 it's perfect. Would definitely recommend!"
4 June 2022,Didn't feel like an MCU product for the most.,5.0,
13 April 2021,Don't let Marvel Fan boys fool you,1.0,"First 3 episodes were Boring, I could care less for the setting time of it, I made sure not to fall into the BS hype theories. The show was typical Marvel ending. Boring CGI and lame villains."
10 July 2022,It was overhyped.,7.0,"Now I didn't mind Wandavision it was the first Marvel Disney+ show and a lot of people were excited and because of that they were really promoting the crap out of this and people made wild out theories that never happened. That is what made me not like the show. But now to get to the show. It starts off with a big mystery right in the beginning it really makes you think what is going on and then you really want to figure it out. Since a lot of character who were once dead are now suddenly alive with no explanation. You don't know what to believe or who to trust in the show. Every episode acts like a different sitcom. And every episode you slowly start to uncover the big mystery. And if your a big comic book fan you will love the fan Service you get in this show!

The cast does an excellent job at this as well. Elizabeth Olsen does a wonderful job playing the house mom and then playing the emotional wreck of Wanda. Paul Bettany is back and is wonderful in every scene he is in. Kathryn Hahn is one of the best parts of this show playing the nosey neighbour who loves to gossip. Kat Dennings comes back from the Thor movies as Darcy Lewis and is the loving sarcastic character. Teyonah Parris plays Monica Rambeau the little kid from Captain Marvel and she a is excellent additions to the cast. And I can't forgot Randall Park as Jimmy Woo the funniest character on the show!

Overall it's a good show with a mystery you want to solve. It was just overhyped for what we got."
31 January 2021,Amazing!,10.0,Everyone who says that show is bad needs to rewatch all episodes together. It just keeps gettig better.
1 February 2021,AMAZING,10.0,Please don't review bomb this series. WandaVision is really amazing & it hurts to see such a low rating.
5 March 2021,Marvels Masterpiece or Overhyped Trash?,6.0,
6 March 2021,"Fun, first marvel series",6.0,"This was a really fun show, wanting to make you want to know more, but in a few cases there was a few hiccups and side plots that could have been filled in.. the first 7 episodes were great, and partially loved the 7th.. but damn did the last episode let me down, really not fulfilling, but other than that really good show, love to see more of Monica in the movies to come."
15 January 2021,We miss mcu so much,9.0,"With little clues from the first episode, I'm starting to wonder where the series will take us. It is different from other marvel productions impressed me very much. The acting is awesome. The vision in the comic wanted to be a human in a small town. I hope we will see the importance of this in the following chapters."
15 January 2021,Creepy take on Sitcoms,10.0,"Absolutely love this! And it's not for everyone with the sitcom style but don't worry, it won't be a sitcom for much longer. This is all in a different reality. It's got a creepy edge to it that makes it very entertaining!"
10 February 2021,Boring as hell,1.0,"I have never written a negative review, but this is just so boring! I understand that Marvel wants to try something new. But this is just so incredible boring... I'm glad I used the free month of Disney+ to watch it. Now I can cancel the subscription without feeling left out."
30 January 2021,Awful.,1.0,I think I lasted 15 minutes into episide one before I gave up. I wasn't sure what to expect but this is just terrible. Make your own minds up but don't say you've not been warned.
30 January 2021,"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING",10.0,I absolutely LOVE this show. I cannot wait for the rest of its episodes. It's just brilliant.
31 March 2021,Would be good outside of MCU,3.0,"It's a decent show with a decent concept. You can see that people who made it did their homework and their job: ""sitcoms"" mostly seem believable and the only thing where they kinda miss with their shooting format is Office-like parts.

The only thing is wrong with this show, I think, that it belongs to MCU -- and these guys just don't do authentic things anymore. At some points, it just starts feeling fake and one-dimensional, like all of latest Marvel cinematic products do. No matter what, when I watch anything from MCU, I start getting this feeling, very much alike to that of uncanny valley. Something about the character, the story feels artificial and out of place, but I never can put my finger on the particular reason. Maybe, it's my inner cultural critic feeling that these products are nothing more than, well, products, maybe it's something more complex. Nevertheless, WandaVision does it towards the end as well, which really creeps me out.

And yes, it definetely doesn't deserve all the noise around it. Neither any of MCU handiworks, of course, but people like strange things, I guess."
5 May 2021,Most entertaining marvel character to watch,10.0,"JUST WANT MORE AND MORE AND MORE

Honestly hope Marvel and Disney realise how entertaining she is to watch. I could honestly watch and rewatch all of Wanda's scenes through the MCU. I feel they underrate her and don't understand how much marvel fans actually love her and love watching her.

We need more, please don't stop after Doctor Strange 2. I want a series of stand alone films for the Scarlett Witch and more series of WandaVision."
28 April 2021,"Brilliant, Just Brilliant...!",10.0,"Well..! I was excited as it was a Marvel Series and Boy..! I wasn't disappointed one bit. To be honest, this was a twist coming from Marvel as it involves romance. There are many interesting reveals in the series which made Wanda Vision even more entertaining. Fans of science fiction movies/series won't want to miss Wanda Vision. Elizabeth Olsen put up an amazing performance on Wanda Vision, I loved every bit of Elizabeth's performance, she is born to play Wanda's character IMHO. The ending was brilliant too. Jac Schaeffer is a genius for being the creator of Wanda Vision, he has all my respect. Most definitely a MUST watch."
26 January 2021,"Boring, Overly publicised , not that awesome!",1.0,"This show has been all over and they keep saying that this is so awesome? Too much publicity, and the expectation was high but I fell asleep...Boring, not impressed.... the two superheroes as a couple doesnt have chemistry at all awkward."
16 January 2021,House of M,10.0,
9 February 2021,Just WOW! with a big 'O',10.0,There are people who rated this series by watching first 2 episodes. Please just ignore the avg rating right now. This Series is no less than 9.0 rating. Finally Marvel did the weirdest and a unique series.
15 January 2021,Watch bewitched reruns,1.0,Ridiculous. Watch the honeymooners or bewitched for the real thing.
16 January 2021,Starting with a 7...,7.0,"My rating is based on optimism really. We know that everything Marvel does fits into the bigger picture. The show is intriguing, although without patience, I don't see many people coming back to this after the first two episodes unless they're avid MCU fans. It's obvious the show is heading somewhere more interesting, but the sitcom format is kind of hard to get through without more context. They should've released more episodes upfront. Even just a little more context to what's going on I think would help fringe Marvel fans stay with this one. I'll keep tuning in because I know Marvel will ultimately deliver something good, but I don't know if I can speak for everyone else."
26 July 2023,Chaotic Fun,8.0,"WandaVision is the first and best of the MCU Disney+ Shows. It is a captivating story about love, loss, and progression. It's not perfect but is highly creative and unique. The acting is great, the characters are entertaining, and the concept of paying homage to past generations of television is effective in moving the plot forward. Before this series, the characters of Wanda and Vision were mainly on the sidelines and not given much to do. Fortunately, this show does an amazing job at making them complex enough to be in the spotlight at the top of the franchise. Looking it back at the minimal use of them in the past, it is obvious how much potential these two characters have always possessed. Thumbs Up, Indeed."
26 March 2021,Not what you expect (in a postive way),9.0,"Don't be put off by the negative reviews. My guess is that the majority of these people bailed after the 1st and/or 2nd episode. That being said, the first couple of episodes will probably not be what you expect. But give it a chance. I found them captivating and intrueging. Its full of build up, and ""hidden"" hints which make you theorize on what might be going on. The show unfolds into a true masterpiece with the episodes getting better better."
19 February 2021,You see that coming ?,10.0,"Amazing, enjoyable, It holds capacity to give thrill to a marvel fan . Every scene can make you laugh and confused at se time"
18 January 2021,"Something different, like we never seen before !",9.0,"I had my suspicions at first but don't we all? Like everyone I was still excited for this show, and boy oh boy is this show great so far. It's like when you watch it your first reaction to when you first see the show is probably going to be you saying this show is weird. But that weirdness works with the show and what it's about.Plus not to mention this show feels really different from the movies in terms of tone. It doesn't feel like marvel constantly trying to remind you that this is part of the mcu universe. The performances are so good, Elisabeth Olsen is so good as Wanda and she really shines in this show. As well as vision, sorry can't remember the actor's name. I recommend watching it if you're a mcu fan like me. Or a marvel fan in general, or if you want to see something new and different from the marvel movies."
25 January 2021,Mysterious,8.0,Not the normal show I would watch. But it's something different and actually funny. Love the little hints and clues that their is so much more to it. Definitely worth the watch.
12 March 2021,Best Marvel series,10.0,Elizabeth Olsen deserves an Emmy for her performance. The show is amazing and is reintroducing Marvel studios again to us with more deep focus on the heroes and with an essence of a horror movie. The show is perfection! I really hope the next shows and movies that are coming to be at this level as Wandavision
16 January 2021,Amazing !,10.0,Marvel and Elizabeth Olsen at their best ! I'm looking forward for the rest
7 February 2021,What were they thinking?,1.0,
22 July 2021,Stopped 10 mins in,1.0,"If I wanted to watch something like this, I'd go watch I love Lucy."
28 February 2021,Getting There,10.0,"Just hold on a little more if you are planning to not see it after the first 3 episodes because it's getting there it's almost there... I am writing this review after 8th episode and boy oh boy what extraordinary turn of events. If you know what a good show is then you will definitely appreciate Marvel's take at their first show. It's unique,it's fun and most importantly it perfectly sets us up for the upcoming Marvel Magic"
2 February 2021,Ignore every negative review before episode 4,6.0,"It might have been an error on Disney's part to release only the first 2 episodes at once instead of 4 episodes. While I am on of the few people who absolutely loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes, this exceptional show has been getting a lot of hate due to a lack of plot.

... And then the 4th episode came out. Not only was it an exceptional episode, but it justified the use of the first three and even gave some answers to the many questions of Wanda vision.

Overall a brilliant show that shouldn't be judged on the first three episodes (especially if your only complaint is a lack of plot)"
28 January 2021,Not great,2.0,"There is not enough words to describe this dire tripe of a show ... love Avengers hate this

It does get 2stars for originality and that's generous"
18 January 2021,Boring.,1.0,"This is one of the most boring things I've ever watched. And I've seen a film called ""Snake out of Compton""."
3 August 2022,Good Premise but Slowly Withers,7.0,"Wandavision (2021): The first episodes are fun, fresh and mysterious but as times flies, it slowly loses its magic and degrades becoming just another Marvel movie..."
18 January 2021,If only it were funny,2.0,"Olsen and Bettany must have had a blast portraying these characters - unfortunately, it's not contagious. If the writers of the series chose to copy sitcoms from the early days of television, they should have at least made them funny. This is just boring, silly and painful to watch."
7 February 2021,THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING,10.0,This is the start of something completely different for tv and the fact that Disney is taking this risk with Wanda Vision is amazing!
15 January 2021,Just boring.,2.0,"I didn't realise it was a sitcom until I was half way through the first episode but thats not the point. It just was not funny, it was boring, nothing happens. Does anybody know whats actually going on? I don't know whether this is aimed more at American viewers but just not my cup of tea or sense of humour."
14 May 2021,White man bad,1.0,
16 January 2021,This is how entire phase 4 should be... unique and fresh,10.0,Sigh!! People just want cgi fights from the beginning!!WandaVision was always confirmed to follow the sitcom tropes with underlying mystery... don't know why people want same old marvel action heavy content..let them spend some time with the character ... WITHOUT BUILD UP THERE IS NO PAYOFF... action will be there in the 2nd half but keep patience and enjoy the new tone marvel is trying..
26 January 2021,Let's hope episode 4 kicks things off..,8.0,"Nothing really to report so far.. Apart from a 'few' hints, clouded by a weird TV show that I'm sure will become clear in episode 4 (pretty please). Then things start to make sense yes? As you were...

And boom yes... All becomes clear :)"
14 May 2021,One of the most unique and enjoyable shows in a long time,10.0,This show was enjoyable from beginning to end. It was so unique but so well done at the same time. I wasn't sure what to expect when I first started watching it. I would say I'm a pretty big Marvel fan but I'm not the biggest in the world. It seemed like a weird concept and definitely I had my skepticism about it. But it definitely lived up to all the hype and it definitely surprised me at how well it was done. I will not be surprised if it ends up winning some awards. I would highly recommend everyone see it if you're interested in Marvel or just interested in good unique TV shows.
23 July 2021,Could be better...,9.0,
23 January 2021,Have had enough of it,1.0,"This series is probably made for 100yr old americans who like watching western sitcom, tastes of rest of the world be damned. Stop watching it 'y-all' and wait for black widow or eternals to be released to have some real fun"
4 February 2021,Marvel TV,10.0,"Embodies what marvel is all about. Feels like I'm watching a marvel movie in 6 episodes, wait till you get to episode 4 to make a judgement and why don't we all stop complaining because were going to watch anything marvel puts out we may like it or we may not. Show is doing what is meant to and I believe the end will be very good and make up for the past episodes."
19 February 2021,One of best Tv Shows of all time!!,10.0,"I had my doubts in the beginning but I was wrong, WandaVision is INCREDIBLE!!! You all are in for a big treat!! Enjoy!!!!!"
6 February 2021,Great,9.0,Wandavision is just Great. Every Episode gets better.
21 January 2021,A great Series,8.0,
17 January 2021,Be paitence..,9.0,"Be paitence.

We can not judge any show after seeing just two episode. Lets give it a little chance. I hope it will reach up to its maximum."
17 January 2021,Been a while,10.0,Did think It was abit weird at first but enjoyed the comedy to it and the refrences. I dont mind the weekley episodes grew up in the 80's and 90's so nothing new to me. Looking forward to where its heading and seeing the other characters from the movies show up.
21 January 2021,What the hell did I just watch,1.0,"It is too difficult to even write something. What did I just spend my time on. So dreadful, slow, boring... In one word weird. If this what Marvel is become, I am switching to DC. When I see high scores given by some, I immediately think of how someone is trying to pump those numbers up. Seriously it is aweful"
11 February 2021,I'm Not Normal. I Guess,10.0,
29 January 2021,"Slow start, but very intriguing",10.0,"Ep 1 and 2 begin slow and is in my opinion a bit boring since a 1950's sitcom is not really what I'm into, but especially in ep 3 you begin to notice something is wrong. In ep 4 it starts to make sense and it's actually very interesting. I'm very excited for the next episodes. It's definitely worth your time and you should really keep watching even if you don't like ep 1 and 2."
30 August 2022,this is the third review/2nd edit i'm doing on Humor for Yahoos,6.0,"I wouldn't say that this show didn't know what it wanted to be...but i WOULD say that it didn't know what EYE wanted it to be... but since these people are into making money AND it's not too late, here it is... i'd LOVE a prequel/history of how the Scarlet Witch became the Scarlet Witch...i hope SOMEone's working on this... you've got our attention with this character in several shows and movies and i'm SURE i'm not the ONly person who loves 'making ofs'. So why not the 'making of' the Scarlet Witch...they did this with Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow character before she went roaming off...you made money on that, right? Yeah...almost double the budget. Sure, that's not as much as you would've LIKED to've made but it's beer money, at least... anyways...i think this is a good idea. This show turned out better than it began. In fact, i stopped watching it in the first attempt. But then, after someone TOLD me(because how are we supposed to know OTHERwise???), 'oh nooooo...it's NOT like that the whole show through...it's NOT a lame takeoff on 50s sitcoms...'. Yes it is. For most of 3 episodes/almost half the show...but then, in the 4th episode, 'things kick in'...the bigger picture. And then it was watchable for me... and it seems it was somewhat popular. So why not a prequel like you did for the Black Widow, now that you got us interested in the character?"
9 March 2021,MARVELous,9.0,"Marvel never ceases to Disappoint us, it will amaze you episode by episode the way they have connected the Dots, Highly recommendable to Marvel Fans"
5 March 2021,Good Start,5.0,"What a way to kick -off the MCU. The Acting is amazing though there are some flaws. The first 4 episodes were awful or maybe decent at the best After that , The show starts getting good, The story is decent and predictable . The Finale was meh. I feel like the buildup wasnt that strong . There should have been atleast one more episode before the finale . The show is good but there were many flaws in my opinion ."
16 January 2021,Dropping this ten because I'd going to kill,10.0,"So many great questions and I can't wait for them to answer them. So many little details, ugh I love that.

The way they are filming it too is perfect, how else would you know. Just wait..."
5 March 2021,Fabulous,10.0,Man it's simply awesome. Thanks marvel for the amazing series . If you watch the 1st three episodes and ignore it. That's the worst decision you regret in your whole life. A real MCU fan can't miss this Series. It stands as one of the best series.
9 May 2021,"Nice picture, poor scenario",6.0,"The first episode were... strange, but definitely intriguing. Then the story started to take shape.

But in the end... For me it was really bad. I don't want to write spoilers, but if you watched the show till the end and the the ending's issues didn't confuse you... then I have nothing to say. For me the ending was stupid, bungled and disappointing."
18 January 2021,What were you thinking Marvel???,1.0,"So not too sure what Marvel was thinking and making this show but I have a feeling that it's not going to last very long. It makes no sense at all, the cast the plot line what's the purpose of this to see how badly you're going to bomb? Don't get me wrong I enjoyed all of the Marvel movies not all the Marvel TV shows but this one by far is the worst you got laugh tracks in there that don't even want to make me laugh. The only reason why this would make it past the first season is because Disney is producing it otherwise any other company probably would have scrapped it by now.

Way to go and screw up Marvel Disney thumbs up!"
28 January 2021,Good👍,10.0,"It's not bad for me, Wanda acting is fantastic🤘😝🤘"
16 January 2021,Classic,10.0,"Awesome. mcu back with a bang! Such a refreshing show, just the thing you expect from them"
16 January 2021,A masterpiece,10.0,Awesome. Such a refreshing show. MCU back with a bang
7 February 2021,Confusing and lame,4.0,Sorry yes i've also watch episode 4 that reviewers said would make everything clearer and redeem itself ..Sorry but nah the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese. Talking about cheese the comedy aspects are not funny and and very cheesy. another Marvel Flop in my opinion.
15 January 2021,You're Just A Hater,10.0,"Anybody who gives it any low reviews are just simply hating on a show that hasn't been fully developed. The show was fun, and created a dark mysterious atmospheric vibe. People really need to have more patience's with things. The fact that these episodes are like 20 minutes long and people still are impatient is astonishing. You can clearly tell there's a reason for all of this decade stuff happening and I can't wait to see where this season leads moving forward."
15 January 2021,What a waste,8.0,The 50s style sitcom vibe is just trash and the fake laughing is very annoying. I turned it off 12 minutes in.
22 January 2021,"Original, slow burn, bold storytelling from Marvel",10.0,"This is a greatest hits ode to sitcoms over the years with the subtext of a woman dealing with grief and a greater mystery unfolding week to week that will eventually connect with the MCU proper and influence phase 4. Yes please. This is the sort of creativity I want to see from Marvel, a brave move that they must have known would alienate the more Michael Bay loving of Marvel fans. A lot of reviews seem to be frustrated that it wasn't the same as what's come before, but the trailers never hid that fact. Yes, this show requires a bit of patience and some faith in Marvel, but I think they've earnt that. Bring it on."
15 April 2021,Don't give up too early,8.0,"Although you might not know what's happening for the first few episodes, stick with it. It's good!!"
12 February 2021,Actors that say yes to any work.,3.0,This is the biggest disappointment since that 3. Season of twin peaks.
15 January 2021,So far so good!,9.0,"Very addicting. The story is building up pretty nicely, not too fast. Usually in series these kind of plots get revealed in the first episode and the rest of the season is just bleh... Can't wait to see what's coming next!"
14 April 2021,I like i,8.0,I like it but its way to long before it Starts. The First 3-4 Episodes are so Bored and wierd because i didnt know whats going on but on the 5 Episode it started and now i cant wait for the other Season.
9 March 2021,#freeagatha,5.0,"Agatha is my favourite character on this show and what Wanda did to her was just unforgivable. #freeagatha. Wanda is the true criminal. Until Agatha is freed, no rating more than 5 for Wandavision!"
16 January 2021,Tooooooooo bad,1.0,This was very boooring U want the time I wasted back
28 January 2021,KEEP WATCHING! STORY EVOLVES WITH EACH EPISODE,10.0,"If you're a half-watcher or only watch the first episode, pay attention and keep going. Each episode progresses the overall storyline and gives more and more clues to the big picture. It doesn't stay in the same 50s style sitcom as these 1 star reviewers think. KEEP GOING!"
29 January 2021,Ascending,10.0,Just watched episode 4. Looks like we're finally taking off. Ready for the ride.
26 February 2021,Goosebumps Entertainment of year,10.0,"Felling sorry for those viewers who judge show on bases of First two episodes. Mind blowing, extraordinary fantastic, heroic romcom series There's no words to describe this show. But numbers can 10 out of 100. 100% Effort by marvel"
29 January 2021,4 30 min episodes and nothing has happened.,10.0,After 4 episodes ñiterally absolutely nothing has happened to progress the story. Literally absolutely nothing! If they removed all the bloat there wouldn't even be one full episode. This show appears to have been made for preteen girls.
17 May 2022,Interesting concept but not great overall,6.0,"After watching Hawkeye, Loki, Falcon and Moon Knight, I finally took the time to dive into WandaVision. I read the reviews (real ones) prior so I knew what to expect from the first few episodes and after watching ep 1-4, I can definitely understand why people disliked it. Those episodes aren't pointless but they could have probably prepared the audience in one episode versus 4.

Overall, I thought the idea was pretty original considering some of the ""meh"" that's been coming out of Marvel lately. That said, it falls flat due to needless reoccurring dialogue that seems to exist to fill space, not entertain the audience. Part of Marvel's glory has been creating somewhat unrealistic stories that are entertaining, imaginative and fun. WandaVision falls short in all those categories. Everything is too over the top from dialogue to the storyline and it fails to be believable in any way.

Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and Katherine Zahn all do a good job in the acting department (as expected). The series does get better in the later episodes as action and an actual story are introduced. But, the nature of being told via an old television show never pulls together and feels odd by the ending. It just starts to feel silly. When you combine silly with action and superheroes, you end up with a show that is hard to continue to watch.

If they proceed with a season 2, it might get more interesting as they'll likely abandon the old television show overlay which they should have done after episode 2. Due to the acting, characters and history, this show has potential."
4 August 2021,Gets better after episode 3,9.0,"The first 3 episodes were okay/good, but not as good as the rest of the series. What I really liked about the first few episodes were the parts with the hints that something mysterious might be going on in this show, it really made me invested in the story and I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The last 6 episodes were for the most part great. Even though it wasn't all amazing, I still enjoyed most of this show. So I'm giving this a 8 to 8,5 star I think."
28 January 2021,Ughhh not the Marvel tv series i am used to,1.0,"You can actually tell that this is made by Disney, Disney should make only sleeping beauty stories not Marvel...I liked better the Marvel tv series from Netflix, i will miss them"
24 February 2021,Welcome to the world of Maladaptive Daydreamers,8.0,
7 March 2021,Marvel Sitcoms,10.0,I liked how Marvel intertwined classic sitcoms and sets into the series. Made for an interesting concept to the show.
25 January 2021,UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD,10.0,"I don't normally watch tv series but WandaVision got my attention. Extremely unique and exciting but so mysterious. I bet you'll get the most confusing yet so sastifying experience in your life. One thing i loce about this show is that MCU is not afraid to try something completely different but it works out. Not too much yet so much. The best thing about this show is finding easter eggs and trust me..... there are a lot of hidden messages. I saw so many people are divided over this show and all I wanna say is be patient cuz this is definitely a slow burn and they are goin somewhere y'all wanna them to go so..... just give time

Overall, this is unexpectly good so i'm gonna give perfect score

10/10 (MCU has done it again)"
25 January 2021,A MUST WATCH TV SHOW,10.0,"You know i don't normally watch tv series but WandaVision really got me. Extremely unique, exciting and different from any other mcu content than you will ever seen. I gotta say this show, so far, got pretty divide audiences. If you were one of them, I suggested u to patient cuz this is slow burn and the intensive and serious episodes are coming

So far, after 3 episodes, this show can't be more perfect. So sastifying to watch and also a lot of fun to find easter eggs in the background. People are confused like 'wth is goin on?' but that's what this is exactly need to be. Mysterious and creepy

I have to give it perfect score 10/10 (MCU has done it again)"
23 March 2022,"More and more,we want more",9.0,"So good...We want more. Season 2,season 3 and so fourth..

19 January 2021,Great show of talent!,6.0,"Wandavision is beautiful example of paying tribute to the classics. To accomplish the feel of a 1950s era tv show, with the modern filming and story is nothing less than genius. Wandavision delivers great acting, good writing, appropriate comedy, and good story telling. In my opinion this tv show so far has been entertaining, grabbing, and well made. If you want a good story to follow I definitely recommend this show."
19 November 2021,Perfect,8.0,"I prefer all of you to watch this series Only parts 1 and 2 were a bit boring You can fall in love with Marvel world by watching the series.

With strange characters😂🔥"
17 January 2021,"Well, the first 17 minutes of WandaVision were boring AF!",6.0,"If you're an MCU fan then congrats you got an MCU show. I'm curious just how much of the parodying that #WandaVision does of old sitcoms is going to go over peoples heads. The first 17 minutes of WandaVision were boring AF, and it doesn't even draw you in."
28 April 2021,Meh,2.0,"To sum it up in one word: disappointing. Bad start, Good episodes in between and a horrible ending."
27 January 2021,Awful experiment.,1.0,Has Marvel hired Zack Snyder who's an expert in ruining beloved characters with his pseudo-innovative approach. This show is so awful and unwatchable. Watching old reruns would be way more fun then this exercise in creative and artistic nonsense.
5 April 2021,Wasted potential,,
15 January 2021,MCU AND IT'S GREATNESS,10.0,"Don't see these little haters, they are always going to be jealous of MCU. The show was great, loved 50s and 60s episodes, can't wait for more."
7 March 2021,Why that ending!,8.0,I love you Wanda. I understand your sacrifices. But.. why.. I want answers! I want to know more.
4 March 2021,I restarted 3 times and still gave it a 10!,10.0,"Just watched episode 4 and it's just getting better, my brain is going into overdrive plotting out scenarios - LOVE IT. Actually ended up watching the 1st episode 3 times, first on my own - couldn't be bothered to watch the next, second with a friend, they didn't want to continue and last with the oh who definitely didn't want to continue but we persevered AND ARE SO GLAD WE DID - unusually series but absolutely brilliant, well worth a watch if you're a marvel fan."
25 March 2021,TRASH,1.0,"This series is crap, marvel is dead get use to it

24 March 2021,Overrated,5.0,
15 January 2021,This show is super cool,10.0,WandaVision is sup cool and if u r a fan of 90s shows then u must watch it.
1 February 2021,Watch it past the first three episodes,10.0,The only negative is that the episodes are too short. Need to watch it past the first three episodes to actually get into the actual plot and real story line.
19 February 2021,Slow start but when it's good it's awesome!,9.0,"All I'm saying is if you're bored after the first 2 episodes, keep with it!"
16 January 2021,A Marvel Superhero Classic Comedy Series!,7.0,"I watched Its 1st episode and it was like I was watching a Black and White Comedy Movie.It just Hurt my feelings About Wanda and Vision.There is not any action scene in the movie,Its just Romance and Comedy."
6 February 2021,Dont judge before the time,9.0,"There's a reason Marvel has been so successful. They way they are handling this show is genius. Its keeping someone like myself, who's always trying to ""figure it out"", guessing from week to week. It's easy to watch the first 2 episodes and be turned off.... if you don't truly see what's happening, or if you don't already know a few back stories of the characters. I wasn't sure if Marvel would be able to maintain the level of success that they've had, but it's looking for from here. Just wish DC would copy the blueprint"
8 February 2021,Most boring show on tv,1.0,"If you want to watch repeats of Bewitched, then this is for you, Set in the black and white era, the show is nothing but laugh tracks and horrible acting."
7 February 2021,The plot thickens,9.0,"So far I have loved the show, it keeps you guessing, you think you know what everything after the first couple episodes but the latest episode makes you start to question what is really going on"
26 February 2021,STICK TO IT AND KEEP WATCHING,10.0,
16 January 2021,Try too hard as Sitcom with MCU Heroes,1.0,After finish all of MCU movies followed with this Wandavision series sounds very promising but if you expect this series still related to the Avengers better forget it as this will waste of time unless we are looking an alternative sitcom with black amd white style and later will be followed with more colors.
15 January 2021,I laughed out loud,10.0,This show is filled with wonderful humor and nostalgia with a sinister undertone. I have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far.
21 February 2021,Great build up.,9.0,First time these characters are in comics accurate look so I did really enjoy it. Hopefully next episodes are gonna reveal more answers .I think this is going to be the best ever marvel series
7 March 2021,"Ground breaking ""tv"" experience",10.0,
16 January 2021,"I am paying attention, it's taking too long to get there",4.0,"If this was a comic episodes 1/2 are what I would skip through looking for the action. My wife was upset we turned off her show she was watching to try this.

I'm sure it will get to it's point, I'll read spoilers about it, but I wasn't hooked enough to care about what was wrong in what is clearly a mental health thing."
22 January 2021,3 episodes and who cares?,1.0,
18 January 2021,After 2 Episodes I pass,4.0,Wanted to like it...probably the most hyped Disney + original....but I didn't...very disappointing...
15 January 2021,Genius,8.0,"This is an incredible show. The setting, tone, and ideas behind WandaVision is really great. As promised, the first few episodes are set in different eras of classic comedy shows, and it certainly delivers just that. Each episode had a distinct asthetic and tone, very well executed. The acting is great, but the real stand out here is Elizabeth Olsen. Wow. She totally understands what she's there to do, and boy did she deliver. I can't wait for more to unfold, there are definitely a few intriguing plot points that draw you in for more.

I can't understand putting a slow burning show week to week in this day and age, but that is my only critisism. And thats more to do with Disney+ subcription and viewership decisions than anything else, not the show."
4 March 2021,"Don't waste your time, just read the comics",7.0,"This show is atrocious. Don't understand all the good reviews. Each episode consists of 30 minutes of meaningless sit com tropes that add nothing to the story and in the last few minutes a reveal meant to shock us (which of course you can see a mile away). The first 3 episodes (a third of the entire show) contributes nothing to the characters or plot, nothing happens. An entire episode dedicated to the protagonist's past is 40 minutes of flashbacks that mean nothing as we already know every detail that is shown from previous movies. The entire episode accomplishes nothing. All in all the show is a waste of time the amount that happens could easily fill a standard 1 hour episode of a well written series with time to spare."
15 January 2021,Wtf did I just watch?,3.0,Ehh.. This is just weird. I thought it was some kind if funky intro. But it turns out to be a cringe black and white 'dad humor' sit-com thingy. Two episodes in and I pass. Damn. Hoped to see some Marvel Magic!
12 May 2021,It's Something else for sure,9.0,"First two episodes will confuse you but if you accept it, its brilliant."
6 March 2021,very good,9.0,Hard to get into but once you do it's very good i love wanda and learning more about her in a domestic environment
22 February 2021,The final nail in the coffin,3.0,"By now, almost every follower has already watched Wandavision's episode 7. Those who managed to stay awake should reach the same conclusion as me: this is game over. Actually, this epic failure was expected after last episode's nonsense and mediocrity in the sitcom part. It's very clear to me that writers don't know what to do to extend the show to complete the ten episodes. They're attached to a format that hinders the road to the final outcome. Innovation and daring are not necessarily guarantee of an accomplished product, despite the one sided reviews we can read from people who probably are there for the visual effects. From now on, it makes no difference what this mess is leading up to. Episode 7 convinced me, once and for all, to stop wasting my time in this pretentious, overqualified show. And to stop listening to those intellectual snobs claiming this is a Marvel masterpiece."
22 July 2021,Vision of Illusions,9.0,Nice movie ..must watch to watch further Marvel Movies.
16 January 2021,Great,7.0,"This show is not for the narrow-minded. Its funny and actually quite spooky.

People won't like it because it doesn't have superheroes flying about with big SFX explosions. Its world building and its actually a spooky world - how did they get there, they don't seem to know...

Give it a chance, stop hating because you're not open to new things, it's supposed to be a reenactment of old 50s/60s sitcoms as they show the perfect life, which is what they are living right now, but not all is as it seems, ""the devil is in the detail""."
27 February 2021,Stay calm & have watch whole series,9.0,All you questions will be answered. This is one of the genius creations of Marvel
28 September 2021,It's ok,8.0,"I'l give this an 8/10 just because the ending and the first 4 episode was boring, I watched the show halfway but I stop because it's boring, but episode 5 to 8 was quite interesting."
17 January 2021,Great show but in the Dark,8.0,I only know a little background of the show from interviews with the 2 stars promoting it. The way first show starts you have no clue what its about nor after. Are these two married ? One is an android the other appears to be human. Where are they heading. Why are they together? A million ques and no answers.
6 February 2021,Just amazing,10.0,Superb comeback after little break........ Mind blowing twists every week.
11 February 2022,Baffled....,3.0,"I thought that this was a show that was a parody-SCIFI take on classic sitcoms. BIG SURPRISE...it is a comic book tvseries based on MCU.

I loved where they were part of the old sets ala Bewitched, Dick Van Dyke, The Brady Bunch, Full House (an inside joke as Elizabeth Olson is the younger sister of Mary Kate and Ashley who found fame on that show!!!) etc. But anything that was part of STORM and The Avengers, etc. Etc. Was boring and made me stop watching.

...where is my Evan Peters???????? I am guessing he comes on near the end of the season."
27 February 2021,So very fascinating!,10.0,"For anyone who hasn't watched it yet or is thinking about watching it, don't overthink it..this is by far one of the top series I've ever watched in my entire life! Everyone's performance in this is stunning but Elizabeth's is simply captivating and breathtaking!

The first 2 or 3 episodes do NOT represent the true essence of what this show is about, so don't misjudge it from its beginning.

For those who just rushed in to give it 6 stars and below, and calling it boring and a disappointment, next time please actually wait until you've seen at least half of a series' season....."
23 May 2021,"Good premise, terrible ending",5.0,"I was curious about this show because of the premise. I have to say though that the first two episodes were tedious. It does not pick up until episode 4. (Episode 3 was just okay.) The middle of the show is fine but the ending devolves into the usual cartoonish super hero action movie drivel.

This show could have been so much better than it was. It did not need some villain plopped in without motivation. Some reviews emphasize the shows handling of mental illness but I found that handling quite pedestrian. I suppose if you don't live with mental illness or have nobody in your life that has mental illness, the show might seem sophisticated, but it is not.

I was planing to take a look at the Mandalorian after this, but I think I'm just going to skip it and cancel my Disney+ subscription."
30 January 2021,Very good,10.0,I loved it. Overall rating should be higher than 7.
8 February 2021,Terribly overrated,4.0,"Although I appreciate the attempt to be different, this show feels like it's entirely based on gimmicks that are used again and again. We get it: you're copying old sitcoms. You really shouldn't milk that to death in every episode.

Also, when they were talking about Captain Marvel & Scarlett Witch, it was just not only heavy-handed ""women are strong"" moment, but also doesn't make any sense that they would know that. I guess the characters watched the movies?

Last but not least, the multiverse stuff they just added in... That's just lazy writing, shock-factor gimmicks."
9 May 2021,"Incredible cinematography, solid story, great special effects, what's not to like?",9.0,"Great follow up series to Endgame The TV sitcom vibe that changed each episode was incredible - great scoring, the commercials, humor, spot on.

Great backstory to Wanda Several layers of depth to the characters and themes."
15 January 2021,REWIEW BASED ON EACH EPISODE,7.0,"Marvel have always been doing things which may look different in the start but after sometime story changes and things changes EPISODE 1: building story but boring EPISODE 2: Boring but ""SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENEND IN THE END""

If you call me a fanboy then yes I am but I'm rating it 5 based on first couple of episodes....I know marvel loves giving surprises , hope this show ends well.

""may change the rating after watching upcoming episodes""

EPISODE 5: ""SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF YEARS"",WOW,just WOW...didnt expected anything like this and yes its not what its look like in starting ,its getting interesting with every episode

"" Changing rating from 6 to 7 ,expecting a blast in last 4 episodes'hopefully'"""
7 July 2021,Thank you MCU,9.0,"I Love It. So many negative reviews about the beginning. For myself, its brilliant. A lovely served meal with a great starter. Its a innovation and it absolutely worked.

I watched it a couple times and it felt just good."
22 August 2021,Amazing,10.0,"This show had literally everything. Suspense, magic, comedy. The acting was amazing as well. Please watch it especially if you want to remember every sitcom show since the 50'."
16 January 2021,Don't watch if you lose attention easily,1.0,The first two episodes fail to be intriguing and the satire on 20th century sitcoms just brings back laugh tracks. I wonder where the 25 mil per episode went?
29 May 2021,Well written with Amazing Actors,9.0,
30 January 2021,"Marvel haters, atleast try to love the content despite where it's coming from",10.0,Marvel fans will surely love it. Other people might have fixed feelings until episode 4. Marvel haters or DCEU fans might be giving bad ratings for this because WW84 was a disaster.
3 March 2021,Exceeding my expectation,10.0,"Unlike movie format, TV series format really allows the characters to shine, as we all get to look at them from different angles.

I love the fact that the show dares to try and experience a new and unusual way to tell the story. I understand the frustration of people during the first 3 episodes. But for me personally those are fantastic: they don't go where most people expect and that makes it so interesting and refreshing to watch. Then comes episode 4 that connects all the dots, making the whole experience much better and meaningful.

The series is designed to explain Wanda power orgin and its potential to become even more powerful, while carrying this relatable theme of grief and the importance of overcoming it.

One of the best TV series I've seen in recent years."
8 February 2021,Shervin,10.0,WandaVision is so over the top bananas but it works in a weirdly entertaining way! I don't get some of these negative reviews though...did you not watch the trailers? Some of you are acting surprised at what you were watching. I don't get it...what were you expecting that you didn't see? It's a wildly original show that's such a fun ride that you can't turn away and that absolutely pays off in the end. It's a fantastic addition to Phase 4 of the MCU. Elizabeth Olsen is so amazing here that she absolutely deserves an Emmy nomination! I can't wait to see what's next!

6 February 2021,Read this before watching!,10.0,"As I am reading 1 star reviews I am understanding that people have a lack of knowledge for the reasoning on why this is a show and the background story, and not knowing that this isn't a show that is meant to be a funny sitcom, but has so much more meaning into the story about Wanda after Avengers Endgame.

This is a TV Show like no other and is incredibly unique and entertaining. Though, to watch this show you need a basic understanding of the storyline of the MCU, otherwise you may feel lost in the story and find it confusing at some points.

If you aren't familiar with the MCU storyline and haven't enjoyed this show, do not rate this show off first impressions because you don't understand it.

Mind blowing and extremely talented show, I have never watched anything like it."
8 February 2021,Awesome,10.0,5 episodes in and Wandavision has not disappointed. Can't wait for what's to come
15 January 2021,Awesome,10.0,I watched 2 episodes and it's like awesome.Elizabeth olsen steals the show. The incredible move by marvel ever.
8 February 2022,Misses the mark,5.0,"Don't get me wrong, after enduring years of awful TV and movies, it was nice to watch a show that genuinely tried. All the elements were there, but the payoffs were sadly missed. Entertaining, definitely. Good, sure. Great? No."
19 March 2021,If you start watching:,9.0,"If you start watching, watch the whole season before you quit"
14 July 2021,Wanda Vision Review,10.0,The show was great !! Definitely looking forward to season 2!!
11 March 2021,Hidden gem yet already polished,8.0,"If you followed avengers saga then this is a must watch series, it started like usual sitcom but the evolution of plot truly deserved this series as a strong connecting bridge for the MCU, also don't miss the traditional post endings, very worth it."
16 January 2021,Ummmm,1.0,I know we are only 2 episodes in but god its boring and very disappointing. Hopefully it gets better. Its just feels like a rip off of Bewitched.
21 January 2021,Creepy fun:),8.0,Special way of recording with funny content. Meanwhile u also feel a bit creepy which made it even bette:) looking forward for the next episode.
23 January 2021,Very slow start but has great potential.,6.0,
15 January 2021,25 million per episode and this is the result?,1.0,Overhyped by Marvel fanboys. 5/10 at it's best. It was a huge risk and the first 2 episodes failed to impress me. Disappointed. The only good thing is Elizabeth Olsen's acting.
23 January 2021,Genius,10.0,"This show is amazing on so many levels. In just three episodes it has managed to subtly both pay tribute to and make fun of every major sitcom of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. And it does it in clever and intelligent ways. And yet somehow there is an Avengers subplot brewing deep inside it, but they are giving away details so slowly it's both painful and terribly addicting at the same time. And through all of it, it is overtly doing well as a cute and harmless sitcom."
29 January 2021,Reality Bending Sitcom,10.0,"This show just keeps getting better! While the first episode was a bit slow starting, it's all up from there. Episode 4 has been mind blowing, and I can't wait to see where this goes from there!"
15 January 2021,Amazing!!,9.0,"It's very interesting that all these 1 star reviews are calling all the 10 star reviews fake. It's hilarious to me because everyone has what's called an opinion. In my opinion, the show is amazing. Usually with all shows it takes a little bit of time to get going. Don't judge so harshly when you've only seen the first two episodes. That's not really a fair review. Love it or hate it, but at least wait until you've seen it all."
17 February 2022,It should have been a little bit more action!,6.0,"""WandaVision"" begins very slow... You don't really know what is happening in the show and you doesn't even know when the action is taking place, because the only clue that you have is the fact that you know that this TV series is happening sometime after the ""Avengers: Endgame"". Anyway, as soon as the episodes unfold, you find out the truth and everything starts to makes sense.

This show it's not bad, but it's not great either! It has some very funny and emotional moments, but I guess that it lacks its action and more precisely, you don't get to see any action until the last episodes. Even the main antagonist it's not really too threatening, because somehow, the show creates the idea of predictability and you know that however strong the villain is, in the end the protagonist would always win.

""WandaVision"" it's not bad and it should not ruin your time, especially because I guess that it's very important for the future MCU's projects. I suggest you to watch the prior MCU's movies before watching this, all of them, if you have the time and the mood, but if you lack the patience, I guess that the movies ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", ""Captain America: Civil War"", ""Avengers: Inifnity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"", should be enough, in order to understand what is happening during this show! Don't forget about the after-credits scenes."
16 January 2021,Love it,10.0,"Great show so far, especially if your a Marvel fan."
29 January 2021,Funny Marvel Series with no nudity & profanity . How is that possible?,9.0,"Wanda Vision in disney + is the first MODEN comedy noir MARVEL series I HAVE SEEN with very little (too non so far) nudity, horrible violence, almost no vulgarity since it remakes 60 style movies. I highly RECOMMEND! STILL WANT TO KEEP UR COMMUNIST NETFLIX CHANNEL?😖"
22 January 2021,Slow burn mystery under the cover of Sitcoms,9.0,"Premiere/Ep1-2 review:

It's definitely a fresh direction for MCU, and it's definitely a slow burn mystery. Interesting and unique to take on sitcom style. For a series this format suits best. Elizabeth Olsen & Paul Bettany both showcase their talent with the time & variation offered being a series. Overall from the first two episodes the fans are in for a treat.

Episode 3 :

The sitcom style remains but takes a step back for the story and MCU continuity cements. The comedy holds but is played off in Wanda's powers abnormality. It feels like the beginning of the story & pay off of the set up from first two episodes."
23 January 2021,Garbage,10.0,"This show should be on the CW or WB. It seems to be a low budget sitcom made for teenage girls. It is not interesting,exciting, suspenseful, or interesting. What a waste."
16 April 2023,50/50,6.0,"""WandaVision"" is a 2021 television series created by Jac Schaeffer and directed by Matt Shakman, starring Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany as Wanda Maximoff (aka Scarlet Witch) and Vision, respectively. The series takes place after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and follows Wanda and Vision as they live a seemingly perfect suburban life in the town of Westview. However, as the series progresses, it becomes clear that all is not as it seems.

One of the strengths of ""WandaVision"" is its unique format. The series pays homage to classic sitcoms, with each episode taking place in a different decade and featuring a different sitcom style. This approach could have easily felt gimmicky or forced, but instead, it serves as a clever way to explore Wanda and Vision's character development.

Olsen and Bettany both deliver strong performances, with Olsen in particular showcasing a range of emotions as Wanda struggles with her grief and trauma. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, Kathryn Hahn as Agatha Harkness, and Randall Park as Jimmy Woo.

As the series progresses, it becomes clear that there is more going on than just a simple sitcom homage. The series delves into complex themes such as grief, trauma, and the power of imagination. It is a testament to the writers and directors that they are able to tackle these weighty topics in a way that feels organic and never preachy.

The series also features some impressive visual effects and cinematography. The use of practical effects and old-school visual trickery adds to the charm of the sitcom homages, while the more surreal and unsettling moments are beautifully shot and edited.

While ""WandaVision"" is an excellent series overall, it is not without its flaws. The series' pacing can be a bit slow at times, and some of the early episodes feel more like a novelty than a fully fleshed-out story. Additionally, the series' finale has been criticized for feeling rushed and not fully delivering on some of the plot threads that were set up earlier in the series.

Despite these criticisms, ""WandaVision"" is a standout entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a unique and engaging television series. The series' format, strong performances, and exploration of complex themes make it a must-watch for fans of the MCU and anyone looking for something a bit different in their television viewing."
16 January 2021,What?,1.0,"There's obviously (and that really is obvious, rather than a mystery), more to this than meets the eye. I made it through to the end of the first episode either waiting for something beyond an extraordinarily bad 50's sitcom pastiche and it didn't materialise- all of the tropes, none of the jokes. Not even bad ones.

I have to confess I soon begun to fast forward through the second episode, pausing for snatches to see if the tone was going to alter, some sort of direction was going to emerge, something that would lift it from an astonishingly tiresome affectation of period without much in the way of content.

I really wanted to like this, but if what has happened so far is some sort of extended setup, it's an extremely laboured one. I'm not sure if I can sit through another half an hour of this and can't for the life of me imagine who is enjoying it.

Grim, turgid, witlessly painful stuff so far. I don't think it's just disappointment. Actually if I'd come to this without any expectation I don't think I would have watched more than ten minutes.

I can't give away any spoilers because I can't for the life of me say anything actually happened.

Awful."
27 January 2021,What????,1.0,How on earth did this show make it on the air and manage ratings above a 1 or 2? Utterly pointless and stupid in every way.
15 January 2021,A breath of fresh air,10.0,"It's something different. Something new. Marvel has to start shaking things up else it will become the same old. Why can't people embrace change? People here are only giving it 1 stars without seeing it all first. We're obviously expecting twists and turns throughout this. Embrace something new and keep an open mind and who knows, you may even enjoy it!"
1 May 2021,"Driving Off A Cliff, Thelma & Louise Style.",5.0,"Wandavision is, so far, one of the most interesting experiences I've had this year. The long awaited primer Marvel TV show to show the MCU's new colors, debuts with a very solid presence, as it flaunts its unique concept with contagious confidence. The series follows the eponimous Wanda Maximoff and Vision, as their traumatic runaway lives finds them starring in what appears to be a series of american sitcoms. I can't say for certain if this is the first show to ever execute the idea of theming every episode around an era of television history, cronologically going forwards in every episode, as the black & white becomes technicolor, and the clothing goes from conservatist to bombastically hippie. But if it is the very first incarnation of such an idea, then kudos to Marvel and the showrunners for creating such an interesting concept.

Still, for as exciting as it was to wait for every new episode, WandaVision still resulted in a mixed result. As the series engages in its first, second, and former third acts, it maintains its dramatic momentum, with its unique aesthetic, era-inspired comedy, building up on the tension of the mistery surrounding the show. The performances are praise worthy, as the choice of new and returning characters (with some fun casting surprises), having the spotlight shine on Olsen's and Bettanny's as they play this characters as never before, clearly having as much as fun as possible in the process. It its in its latter third act, however, where things fall apart, quite dramatically, in fact, as the series surrenders much of its vision (pun intended) to tap into its greater picture. The final episodes felt rushed and unfinished, grasping for straws not only as it transitions back into the actual MCU, but as it tries to needlessly subvert the audiences expectations, even daring to throw away its own setup.

And an interesting side note: the special effects fall extremely short, sometimes displaying gilmpses of the cringeworthy creative/cinematgraphic CGI practices of the CW shows. At first, I gave the show some slack given the thight budgets of episodic formats, but as of today, the first episode of Falcon & Winter Soldier was released, effectively aging WandaVisions effects by a decade. Marvel seems to be willing to make the investments towards making this shows have film-like quality in its special effects, given the exciting first part of today's Falcon episode. They seem to have denied WandaVision such commodities, for some reason, as its effects look on par with Age Of Ultron, a movie that itself looked worse than its predecesor.

At its worst, WandaVision is an future MCU commercial, less subtle than the actual timely mockmercials present in every themed epìsode, as its sequelitis slips through the cracks, promising future productions instead of present cohesiveness. At its best, however, WandaVision shows glimpses of its own independant strenght, and it makes me wish it dared to stand prouder on the merit of its unique concept as a more standalone production. Of course, still connected with the wider universe, but more commited to its own arc, daring to fully embrace its love for television. Cuz', honestly, don't we all love it, too?"
15 January 2021,What was it,1.0,Smile never appeared on my face. First episode absolutely not interesting. Waiting for loki guys.
9 February 2021,Spectacular show for marvel fans and non marvel fans.,10.0,"Very entertaining show. Ties into with the MCU however feels away from the mcu at times. If you love mystery TV show genres, this show is great."
22 March 2021,one of the best,10.0,It is one of the best things marvel has done elizabeth olsen and paul bettany are amazing and I'm so happy they got to flesh out there characters more.
15 January 2021,Astounding. Best thing from Marvel so far.,7.0,It's shocks me how Marvel is taking such a massive risk with this show. And show far it's amazing. The episodes are so mysterious and they slowly get more and more fascinating. I'm dying for more. The advertisements in between are awesome nods to Wanda's character in the MCU and the fact that each episode has recreated the vibes of the decade is astonishing. Episode Two has some of the most interesting moments.
15 January 2021,Strange but intriguing,7.0,"It's definitely far too early to say that these early episodes are insane. The main story felt very average with some funny, goofy gaffs in-between. However, you certainly know that it's building up to something big, especially with subtle hints being thrown all around subtly and not-so-subtly. This show is going to be a slow-burn and is going to become a lot better as the true, Marvel plot reveals itself from the disguise of 20th century sitcoms."
5 February 2021,Terrible,,Omg how do they go from avengers to this. I know it's a tv series but it's more worthy of a negative rating than a positive.
26 February 2021,Marvelous,10.0,"Wooooooow , exciting, Exceeding expectations it's the bessst

Wowoow"
19 May 2021,"Great idea, mediocre execution",5.0,"The idea is, a woman with supernatural powers creates a pocket universe, which takes the form of a TV show, in which each episode is a different decade. So the show makers get to do a tribute to the styles of the 50's, 60's, 70's, and so on, as they develop the plot of why this is all happening.

Unfortunately, the big plot takes place in the Hollywood Superhero universe, in which everything is dumb and predictable except for the inevitable Big Twist about who is on which side of a dumb black-and-white morality.

Also, none of the episodes are as good as the shows they're paying homage to, which makes me think we aren't really in a golden age of television.

The best thing about Wandavision is Kathryn Hahn's performance as the nosy neighbor, and she's done a lot of stuff better than this."
25 February 2021,YES I'm giving it a 10!,10.0,"For my part - and just to be clear, I do hate watching trailers. Yes, I can't deny it. I was reluctant to continue the Pilot after the first few minutes, but I chose to give it a try. I was right to do so ; the show is magic. It starts slowly in a 50's Sitcom mood with some good practical jokes to turn to an insane story. For those who have started it and have decided that it was not worth their time, give it a second chance."
19 March 2021,somebody tell me one thing,,"Paul bettany is a very underrated actor. like movies Margin Call, Master and Commander i loved his acting and when im saying movies i do mean movies, not the disney junk. im afraid this series will be the reason his carrier will go downhill. i hope he can discuss to have better production and writing. i dont want him to be in a washed up, past-his-prime actor category."
15 January 2021,"Weird, Funny, Goofy, Creepy",10.0,Oh God! This show is more weird(in a good way) than our expectations. First 2 episodes are hilarious. It has some creepy moments. MCU really take a huge risk. One of the most unique superhero content.
15 January 2021,Pâle copie de ma sorcière bien aimée,1.0,Je ne comprends pas le but de la série ! La série est surjouée de manière intentionnelle mais c'est pathétique et ennuyeux.
24 January 2021,Silly,3.0,"I really don´t get what is the objective here. The show is totally silly, nonsense in front the nowadays minds. Maybe it would be great in the 50´s, but com on, not even a 5 year old child will find this interesting. If you are under 3 or over 80..go forward."
15 December 2021,Best Marvel TV Show,10.0,"This show was an experience to watch. It was so fun to watch and I couldn't watch the next episode soon enough. Being a HUGE marvel fan, it was so fun to see what they would do next. Marvel has never really done anything like this and it was so cool to see where they were going to take this show. Even the energy around the show with everyone watching it and coming up with all these theories that we thought would happen. Each episode catches your attention and didn't give it back. The acting was phenomenal and definitely worth the 22 awards it has won. The visuals were also stunning, as usual for marvel project. The way that they added to the plot in every episode and then revealed it all in the last two episodes was so easy to follow and you never expected what happened. The finale leaves you on a bit of a cliff hanger. It explains most of what happened very well but it still left you wondering, what is she going to do know? And some other questions about the future of Wanda and Vision. It will always be my favorite marvel tv show and one of my favorite all time tv shows."
7 February 2021,Thanos save us,1.0,"So incredibly horrible. Black and white start, slow, boring.... just the cringiest garbage I've seen in a long long time. Nevermind the 7 minute credits at the end making you think you are getting a longer show than you actually do. Nothing makes sense, and not in a ""oo cant wait to see what happens"" kind of way but more of a ""wth are they thinking writing this trash"" kind of way.. i keep skimming the episodes to pass the sitcom junk parts hoping it blows wide open and gets good, but nothing yet. If the writers don't ditch the gimmick this show will fall flatter than a pancake. Xmen movies were great. Days of future past quicksilver kitchen scene was one of the best scenes in a movie I've ever seen. Just epic. They are going to pull legendary x men movie quicksilver into their defunct avengers world, really?? The avengers is a mess. Disney is a mess. Disney is absolutely ruining the marvel universe. Thanos please, put us all out of our misery so we don't have to struggle through another episode."
16 January 2021,Intriguing,9.0,"Based on the two episodes available, I can say that the show makes you want to know what is going on; it makes you curious. The balance between tension and comedy is absolutely genius. I'm looking forward to watching the next episodes."
14 March 2021,Unbelievable,10.0,Could anybody ever expect marvel to make such an emotional web series!
7 January 2022,Wandavision Seasons Review,,

22 January 2021,"For episode 1,2 and 3",10.0,"WandaVision is like nothing Marvel has ever done. It's funny, weird, exciting and entertaining. I loved every minute of it. One of it's strongest points is the fact that's something everyone can enjoy marvel fan or not. It brings you back to old sitcom giving nostalgia to all it's old viewers. Keeps the mystery front and center for younger viewers. And has tones of marvel Easter eggs for the marvel fans to enjoy. This show is for everyone and that's why it's so fantastic. It also has great performances from Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and Kathryn Hahn."
7 August 2022,Little bit boring,,My sister really enjoyed this show I watched a little bit of it and it was ok but not the best and a little bit boring and the story line was fine I guess it was OK but not the best.
22 May 2022,Wandavision,7.0,
8 March 2021,Gets better and better,9.0,Tbh... at first i was a little annoyed by the setting! Ep01-03 was at best 5/10... but it keeps getting crazy and very good and the last two episodes are frggin 9/10! very well performed! thanks marvel
5 March 2021,Started off alright then got stupid,3.0,
11 June 2022,"Good show, bad ending, but redeemed!",7.0,"WandaVision is a good show that does a good job showing Wandas depression, but the ending kind of killed it for me until I saw doctor strange 2. Understanding why the Shaw was the way it was and setting up knew stories. For people who hate this most of you are just toxic theorists who just wanted the X men to show up. Grow the F up!!"
17 June 2021,Meh of the year goes to W.V,6.0,"I'm afraid there's only one word to describe ep 1-3 boring, it got better from ep 4 tho, the villan motive is lost like wanda in her world, the drama was good though."
5 March 2021,Ignore the reviews by all the people who work for Disney,1.0,"This is one of the most over-hyped shows out there. Poor acting, not much plot, easy to spot villains, and simply boring. The fact that the early shows mimicked shows from the 1960s and 1970s that actually were good, did not magically transform this show into being good. You will spend most of your time trying to figure out what they are doing and then turning the sound down when the fake audience laughter (laugh track) starts. Do yourself a favor and watch something that is actually good.

Note that most of the positive reviews are 10/10. These are people who did not watch the show, work for Disney, or are paid by Disney. This is not a 10. I think we can reserve the 10s for Citizen Kane or Casablanca."
12 March 2021,I huge grotesque wart of the MCU's face,1.0,"It's bad. It's so bad that it will have many fans thinking that maybe it's time to give the MCU a break. The first 7 episodes are absolutely unwatchable and meaningless with the stupid retro shows (all filler for lack of actual storyline). Save your time and slip to episode 8. Even then it's garbage, unless you're into witches rather than superheroes."
27 February 2021,It's so awesome,,"The things that happened in this show till now it's amazing and full of twists, you should watch it."
8 February 2021,Eps 1-3 are borderline unwatchable.....,,"........ but I will persist as everyone seems to think it gets better from there. Like a new album, I wouldn't stop listening after three tracks."
14 April 2021,MUST WATCH,10.0,One of the best showes ever watched. Smooth and quick show. With unexpected scenerios.
6 March 2021,Love it,10.0,
5 March 2021,Brilliant,9.0,This the best series ever made...great experience by watching Hats off to MCU
30 January 2022,Surprisingly undermelming,1.0,"Attracted by the great reviews, I expected a really good show.

I was very bored during the first episodes where it's essentially just old sitcoms bs (had to watch it in 1.25-1.5 speed not to be bored to death), but I thought I shouldn't base my judgement just on a few episodes, keep an open-mind and persist because I thought there would be more to it.

So I watched the whole show. Episode after episode I was waiting for an actual breakthrough, something really thrilling and interesting. I thought ""it can't just be about refusing to grief"" and, well, spoiler alert, it's just about that... I found the writing very lazy and was never really moved by the stakes the protagonists face.

I really feel like I wasted my time with this one, I am disappointed. Obviously, there is an audience for it, but I'm not part of it."
29 January 2021,Very disappointing,10.0,This show is not good in so many different ways. It is so slow and drawn out and boring. Definitely not as good as the movies. So far I have watched four episodes and if they removed all the bloat they wouldn't even have a full 30 min episode.
28 July 2021,Arguably the worst show I've ever watched,1.0,"This is arguably one of the worst shows I've ever seen. It took up until episode 5 before anything really happened (and even then it was boring) and the premise of the show is very dull. The only reason I finished it was because if the high rating and good reviews and I was expecting something to happen, but I was disappointed throughout and fail to understand why on earth so many people like it."
7 March 2021,AWESOME SEASON WANDA VISION,10.0,The season was awesome . Loved it. Initial 2-3 episodes were a bit confusing and slow but dont stop watching till the finale episode. Hope Season 2 will be out as well.
22 June 2021,It's torture watching every episode,2.0,"It was painful watching episode after episode anticipating the next one will be good.

I think most of the budget was given to the leading two actors to agree to be part of this bad TV show."
17 January 2021,I see 700 reviews after 2 episodes,8.0,"Many seems to think the show a joke or expect something that it's not. It's not the traditional Marvel show, if you expected that then go watch something else Marvel, there is plenty to pick from.

I think the show SO FAR hits what it should with nailing the sitcom aspect and the origin story for the show.

That said, I will wait to judge the series fully before I seen the whole thing but people are way to fast to jump to conclusion."
24 January 2021,Boring,2.0,"The first 2 episodes didn't have enough intrigue to cut through the over top, and frankly not funny, 50/60s sitcom satire. It couldn't keep my attention. It is a Marvel comic book show. Hit me with some action.

I might try again when the season is complete."
12 March 2021,"Good, not great.",7.0,
16 January 2021,???,2.0,Is it just me or is this show hard to follow? I wish they would explain how they got where they are
26 January 2021,Waw,10.0,"This is amazing, bringin back memories from how tv was back then, and now, evolin, tellin a story after Endgame, connection it with Doc strange ect. Poor girl she suffering because she lost everything."
16 January 2021,Omg,8.0,6 minutes of credits sums this joke of a programme up marvels lost a step here 😴
28 February 2021,You will like it if you are 12y.o kid,5.0,"I really, don't get how it get's 8/10, atm it lacks attention to details and depth of the plot. I only put 5 starts for the great main actors playing."
17 January 2021,Episode 4 changed my mind. Still hate episode 1 and 2.,4.0,"Looking like a DC universe choice. Any votes over 4 and you can tell that everyone on the set and whose job relies on renewal is bumping up the vote.

Must be the same people who watched Wonder Woman 1984 and thought it was good.

*Edit* So far episode 4 has given the series a bit of hope. Time will tell. Has not changed my opinion on episode 1 or 2."
5 February 2021,Good one,6.0,After the horrible 4th episode this episode is pretty good with interesting characters and character conflicts. I didn't like wanda's bad guy speech though. And since when wanda stop caring about other People. Need more explanation.
17 January 2021,Is this Marvel Avengers?,6.0,Two of the most powerful Avengers now living in cheesy Bewitched sitcom!! This is not what we want to see... far from it! I am a massive Marvel fan and this really is bad and I fast forwarded most of it to try and find something noteworthy in the episodes to watch.
4 June 2022,Surprisingly good,8.0,"This was surprisingly good.

The show takes its time to build the mystery.

Elizabeth Olsen really gets to shine here doing a great job as Wanda. Paul Bettany is great aswell.

The two actors elevate the show substancially.

The only thing I found unnecessary was that they had to shoe in a big CGI battle at the end. They could have kept it a bit more subtle in my opinion.

Apart from that there are real emotional stakes here so you are invested in the action.

Well done Marvel."
23 January 2021,So far so nothing,3.0,"3 episodes in, and nothing has happened. It's slow, annoying and I'll probably watch after the season is over so I can binge it in hopes of it getting better and avoid the slow drag wait."
16 January 2021,Sitcom minus jokes,1.0,This show is a sitcom but without being funny. Its boring. Every episode last for 20 minutes and then you can watch 15 more minutes of credits ... Every 20 minutes of episode you could find 10 seconds of something relatable to MCU. Everything else is bad jokes that aren't funny
6 March 2021,"Almost perfect, if Marvel weren't structured the way it was",9.0,"Marvel really outdid themselves with this show. What a beautiful, torturous story of grief, trauma and suffering, additionally unafraid to show that grief drowns everything around when left uncontrolled.

The only thing to criticize is Marvel's structure, that is, the need to make everything lead into everything else. Fun at the beginning, tiring by now, and significantly dragging down the last episode of the show. But this was to be expected, so complaining about it is not very productive.

Show leaves you excited for Phase 4 and makes you appreciate the characters to a new level."
2 February 2021,Watch This Now !,10.0,It is just amazing ! I can not find the true words which can explain how good this show is
1 March 2021,Watch the entire show before writing a review...,10.0,"People need to sit back and give the show a shot before writing a review. So many 1 star reviews based off of the first episode, and to be honest, I enjoyed the first episode. Also, based off of the trailer, it's obvious the show was not going to stay black and white, etc. Highly recommend this show!"
22 January 2021,Nothing to see here (episodes 1&2),4.0,"There was nothing funny or entertaining in the first episode, so we kept watching hoping it would get better. It didn't. The second episode was also dry and unoriginal. You could watch the last ten minutes and pretty much get the story. REALLY hoping the rest of the series has something worth watching."
16 January 2021,Bold and brilliant step for the MCU,10.0,"I'm loving the mystery aspect so far, and I expect that we'll see the reveal pay off toward the end. Also, what did everyone complaining about the sitcom style expect? Massive fights starting with episode 1? Every trailer shows that this is filmed like a sitcom with some underlying sinister tones, and so far the show has delivered. Can't believe y'all want the mystery and questions answered right as the series begins."
7 March 2021,It's been Agatha all along,10.0,"This is the meaning of a 10/10 series. Marvel made an excellent job in their first show, I hope it completes (Ofc it's completing anyway) in this awesomeness. <3"
16 January 2021,Amazing first two episodes!!!,,I loved it these people need to stop judging it when you've only seen the first two episodes. The show is supposed to take place in the different eras of TV! SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
15 January 2021,Rotten...,1.0,What kind of stupidity was this.... whatever the hell you want to explain do it in a 5/10 min b&w crap. This was horrible... i dont even think this will get better....if it does will change my rating
25 January 2021,"Beautifully crafted, approaching genius.",10.0,
18 January 2021,AMAZING and dripping in topical symbolism without being preachy or pretentious (EP.1-2),10.0,
16 January 2021,An incredibly faithful reproduction of old sitcoms,1.0,"Yet unlike the originals, unfunny and uninteresting. Apparently might even go into color TV by episode three (yay).

If this was the intent for the show, it does not work. Maybe it's supposed to be funny?

Would rather scoop out my own eyeballs with a spork than watch another episode as.. entertaining.. as the first two."
20 March 2021,Hopefully it will get better,1.0,"I'm on episode 3 and I can't believe Marvel has fallen so low. So disappointed. I'll give it one more episode, then that's it.

I actually subscribed to Disney Plus so I could watch this..."
29 January 2021,Very disappointed,1.0,One of the worst shows until now every episode is worse than the other
16 January 2021,So funny,9.0,
21 January 2021,Loved it.,9.0,The show is so good so far. I'm going to come back and give it a full rating though after I watch the whole thing .
5 February 2021,Getting good,10.0,"Show started out slow, but every week it gets better and leaving you wanting more"
16 January 2021,Garbage,1.0,"Poorly written with a canned laugh track . Extremely boring , unwilling to watch anymore after the first episode . Shame on disney for this horrible show."
15 January 2021,A Brave New Direction for Marvel,9.0,"Don't go into this show expecting it to be like anything else you've seen from Marvel. While action is nowhere to be seen so far, the intrigue more than makes up for it. So far, I've enjoyed seeing this show as a mystery where alot of the enjoyment comes from trying to figure out just what is going on. Plenty of clues have been laid out if you look for them. The best thing about the show is that it is respecting its audience and allowing us to piece things together ourselves. I hope this new trend continues!

I give the first two episodes 9 out of 10 for balancing intrigue with sitcom charm very well. Hope you like it!"
17 January 2021,Avoid this,2.0,"The show cost 25 million an episode. Where this money went is beyond me since it's black and white and made exactly as the ancient sitcoms. I do not know what happens past episode 2, so far this is quite sub standard, uninteresting and hard to watch. The show is almost a mockery of MCU."
19 February 2021,Boring,5.0,"I know this should be cool and edgy way to enter wandavision, but all and all it is simply boring. It gets better later on, but waaaaayyyy too slowly."
6 March 2021,Just Brilliant,9.0,Short and sweet....i really loved the whole series...even the weaker episodes were engaging...it was exactly what was required fof lockdown
17 January 2021,Popcorn show,1.0,"Its silly, maybe best for the kids to watch, wasn't worth subscribing to Disney+ for"
6 March 2021,GOOD SERIES,8.0,"The series was good and normal and was a preparation for the fourth phase of Marvel movies. But some people thought that there must be interesting and cool theories in the series, so if Marvel was to destroy a strong vilen like Mephisto for one episode There was no choice for his films, in general, this series was to deal with Wanda and bring her to power, which showed well. It was the Mcu series. If you expect everything to be completed in the first phase of Phase 4, do not follow it"
8 February 2021,Watch Past Episode 3,10.0,"I dont want to give away any spoilers or ruin the show. All I will say is WATCH PAST EPISODE 3 and it will all make sense.

Absolutely outstanding. Marvel have excelled themselves."
5 March 2021,Wested!,4.0,"First two are terrible but from 3rd episode it getting interested and in 8 th episode what a twist but 9 th ,the finale ruin the whole series , Elizabeth Olsen told us to Series have a cameo like luke Skywalker in the mandoloarian and now i am very angry😠😠, it's a disappointment to me , time waste of 9 episode"
5 February 2021,Wow ...,10.0,"I can't believe how little imagination some of you have ... it's unreal. This show is amazing. So sorry your limited attention span can't handle unconventional ideas that lead into something amazing.

To be honest, I wouldn't even call this a slow burn. Unfortunate that if it's not action action action then it's not good. Truly some really stupid people on here."
13 February 2021,Amazing and thrilling by far.,10.0,Ive enjoyed every episode so far. Leaves me anticipating for more. I am a big Marvel fan and devoted my life to them. Thanks to Disney for boosting them to another level.
20 November 2022,"WandaVision - A Bumpy, But Fun Ride",3.0,"This show has a lot of ups and downs for me just like Doctor Strange 2, but again, I think that the good mostly outweighs the bad. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany deliver great performances that carry this show. Most of the sitcom episodes are fun and intriguing but can drag on at points and really affect the overall quality of the show in my opinion. The S. W. O. R. D. Plot is cool I guess but is filled with stale and boring characters like Monica, Darcy, and Hayward. That being said, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo is still a joy to watch.

As for the writing, it is intriguing and mysterious or the middle portion of the show, but kind of fizzles of towards the end. Other than the second to last episode, the final episodes of this show are pretty dissaponting. There are some rushed plots and messy cgi battles that just make for a very unremarkeable ending. But one thing this show does well is portray Wanda's grief and this is mostly due to Olsen's amazing performance. I personally think this show has a very cool and creative concept, but could have been executed much better.

7/10."
13 May 2022,An allegory...,1.0,"The premise of this show is basically why slavery and dominion over others can be a good thing. That's right. The over arching theme of this entire ""mini series"" is that sometimes, it can be all right to make others into your slaves."
15 January 2021,Utter Rubbish,1.0,"Watched the first 2 episodes, I'm never gonna get that time back....."
5 March 2021,Move on from Endgame,5.0,"Instead of starting a new storyline, it was a continuation from Endgame that drugged it out further and resolved nothing. Spider-Man far from home did more to start a new chapter with the MCU. This series purpose was troll fans in hoping for the introduction of the x-men by bringing in Evan Peters but totally ruin his story and purpose in the final."
18 January 2021,"Finally, a legitimate high concept piece in the MCU!",10.0,
19 July 2021,Promised a lot more than it delivered,6.0,
24 January 2021,Junk trying to convince you one day it'll be a diamond,1.0,"Why are people giving this good reviews? It's terrible. You watch it thinking it's some kind of funny take on the 50's sitcoms or something but it never reaches the punchline or makes a point. It just ends up being a rehash of things done a thousand times before with no new interesting takes.

There's nothing clever here at all. It's as dumb as it gets, this kind of thing cut the mustard 70 years ago, but people want better now. The laugh tracks are awkward and weird. The actors are great but not even Oliver Reed could deliver this cr*p well.

I watched the first episode twice, thinking I was being unfair, but it was even worse the second time around. I can't even bring myself to watch the second episode and put myself through it again. If it gets smart, I'll start rewatching it, I'm certain in the meantime I'm not missing much watching this drivel. This ain't the Truman Show or Pleasantville

People on here might try to convince you there's something super-secret behind the scenes. But if you have to eat an ice-cream cone of faeces to get to the bubblegum, you might want to question your life."
21 March 2021,"Cool the sitcoms, but week plot",6.0,"I watched all the episodes in one shot... cool at the beginning, than boring."
15 January 2021,Still not so interesting from the first 2 episodes,6.0,"MCU first show wandavision released two episodes today and right now its not my cup of tea The show is clearly parodying the 50s,60s sitcoms but its not actually funny..AND THE LAUGH TRACK IS ANNOYING AF!!!! The only interesting thing in this show TILL NOW is that its connected to the mcu. It would have worked better if they have released the entire season today but they didn't. Right now my rating is 4 . And the characters are not at all interesting till now including the two titular characters we have wait to see how the full season actually it is And for people who complain that they is unnecessary hate for this show its not these two episodes is the most uninteresting and boring episodes of a marvel character i have ever seen It may turn out to be great later on but now BORING is one word for it"
26 February 2021,Wandavision is great,10.0,I need to wandavision be continual because it seems like wanda is a god and she can do everything
17 January 2021,An apt tribute to TV past,10.0,It is so nice to be able to mix my love of classic TV with my love of Marvel. WandaVision is a great Mashup of the two worlds. It makes me smile to watch it. Great job!!!!!
30 January 2021,Unique and fun,10.0,Fantastic up to episode 4 at least. Smart and funny yet filled with dread.
16 January 2021,Waring spoiler,9.0,
20 February 2021,Absolutely loved it,10.0,The fact that marvel has put a movie level effort in this series is just fabulous.
9 February 2021,Don't waste your precious time watching this crap,1.0,"This is the worst marvel show in the entire marvel universe. I hope they spare us from a second season. Disney must be using its super powers to suppress all the negative reviews, because I only found 2. And yes I did watch past the first 3 excruciatingly boring & mediocre episodes to watch an over hyped but also mediocre 4th episode & so this whole sad series continues. There, that's my review. Feel free to waste your time."
30 January 2021,Awesome tv show!!!,10.0,I just started watching tv series and this the first tv show from Marvel as of now the first four episodes are really awesome
5 March 2021,Marvel did it again...,10.0,Again marvel has brought a pure gem of the series which is amazing definitely a must watch series everyone will be addicted to it
18 January 2021,Wait for the all episodes,,Wait Guys just Wait for all episodes and say your opinion after that
5 March 2021,WandaVision,10.0,I absolutely loved it. It's too emotional and explores the past of Wanda. And the ending was also good. But it broke my heart apart. Why it's Wanda to suffer this much 😭
14 March 2021,It is a wandastic show!,10.0,"Intriguing, funny, exciting, confusing and twisting.... The show has a rich content and you see that the filming staff has put lots of effort on it. A must see show for people at any age..."
16 January 2021,Boring so far,8.0,
23 January 2021,The worst super hero tv show since Iron Fist,1.0,"Boring and dumb beyond belief.The gags are silly and very cringe worthy, How did Marvel allow such horrid writing and plot in one of their shows?"
15 January 2021,To Think ...Tony Stark Died For This,1.0,"Can this be snapped from existence?

Awful just awful ...was there a bet at Marvel to see what the fan base would swallow.

Just can't see the point"
5 March 2021,A brilliants start to a doomed end,5.0,
31 July 2021,Terribly put together,2.0,
16 January 2021,It's a masterpiece!,10.0,"I've decided to start watching the series with my mom. She isn't a fan of MCU (she doesn't even know what MCU is), but because of the events that are set in earlier years made me decide to watch the series with my her. The black and white screen, the music, the way Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany act, the 4:3 ratio screen,... made her cry and made her go back to the 50s, 60s; you know the nostalgia, the memories,... This series is heartwarming, touching and I'm very thankful that the series is actually a sitcom (at least for now)."
6 February 2021,Masterpiece with a slow pace.,6.0,"I love the premisse, charecters, mistery. However.. the show its toooo slow, episodes are shorts and give almost nothing. I quit watching it on the 2nd episode until it gets more content like now, watching episode 5 was not as satisfying as I was hoping to be.

Longer episodes... Thats what is missing."
15 January 2021,I don't get how people hate this...,10.0,"Why do people started hating this already? It's an amazing different and ""something new"" show that combines the characters of Wanda and Vision with the old times. Some people just want to see Endgame fights in all of Marvel movies and series. Calm down people , it's an amazing series for anyone to enjoy even if you are not a Marvel Fan. It's the same people that didn't like the Joker latest movie because there is not enough action and killing scenes."
10 April 2021,"Impressive and just like another marvel legacy, I mean awesome",10.0,"Another craft work from marvelous marvel studios. The star cast was so strong that she I mean Wanda has become my part of reality like you and me. Storyline was a bit slow at the beginning but we all know magic is in the finish. Yes, you are not mistaken, you can count me a big big Wanda fan. Love you."
18 February 2021,very good,10.0,"It might have been an error on Disney's part to release only the first 2 episodes at once instead of 4 episodes. While I am on of the few people who absolutely loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes, this exceptional show has been getting a lot of hate due to a lack of plot.

... And then the 4th episode came out. Not only was it an exceptional episode, but it justified the use of the first three and even gave some answers to the many questions of Wanda vision."
16 January 2021,To The Haters,10.0,"To all of the people giving WandaVision bad reviews, what is wrong with you? Those where only 2 episodes and you are saying you are Marvel fans no you are not because you didn't even give the show a chance. And again you only watched 2 episodes of it which where very good and funny, but I have two say and 2nd episode is going to expand to the other episodes

So if you do not like the show and will not watch it anymore DONT LEAVE A REVIEW!!!!!"
5 February 2021,An interesting start that got ruined from the show's fourth episode.,5.0,"The pitch of WandaVision is basically two supers living in a small town with some Twilight-Zone vibes.

During the first episodes, the surreal atmosphere and the old-shows references is quite appealing. That alone could have held up my interest for a while but I was also eager to see each next little mystery happen. Of course, it doesn't take a genius to guess the broad lines but thankfully there were hints, threads and questions dropped here and there to flesh-out the fine detail. I really had some hopes for the show. After The Mandalorian maybe Disney finally decided to stop making crap. I should have known better. All of it lasted three episodes.

From the fourth episode, the tone changes as a few new characters are introduced : most of them are basic archetypes, a couple are insufferable.

Why is it the writers had to put a woman as a high-ranked scientist (whose qualifications should have nothing to do with the situation at hand) but depict her as a toxic creature best to be avoided?

Why is it the writers didn't care to check if the ""techno-babble"" they make her say doesn't sound incredibly stupid to anyone with a basic understanding of the words she uses?

The writers could also do with more subtlety in their ""military guys stupid and bad"", ""military women thoughtful and good"" routine. There are so many cues it stings. I could rant on an on, but not without spoiling.

In a nutshell, from that point forward one half of the show becomes shallow, childish, naive and stupid. The other half is falling apart.

What a disappointment."
25 May 2021,Incredible tv series from marvel,8.0,Watch now on disney+ exclusive this tv series entertained u a lot go and watch now mcu is connected to their tv series also go watch.
21 January 2021,What a load of s**t,1.0,"As a huge fan of marvel I must admit I was hugely looking forward to seeing this, however I've never been so disappointed. Its trash so far with the 1st and 2nd episode really boring I fell asleep half way through the second episode, and when I woke up I thought thank God it's over. I will carry on watching the series however I'm expecting a lot more from the studio and story line"
16 January 2021,Seriously? People really will give anything marvel perfect ratings,1.0,It's just not very good. But hey since it's a pandemic and it's Disney it gets 10 stars regardless
10 May 2021,Nice mini series,9.0,Overall it is a excellent mini series. Watched it full from ep 1 to ep 2.
17 March 2021,"Ignore Negative Visions , It's a good Wanda Vision",9.0,
30 January 2021,On episode 4,10.0,"It starts off a little slow. I wasn't sure what to think. To be honest, I was getting slightly disappointed. I'm glad I waited to review. Don't give up on it. It gets better. It's not a movie, so you won't get answers on the first go."
15 October 2022,Drivel,2.0,
17 January 2021,3 minutes in...,3.0,"Absolutely God awful. Jesus, who green lit this garbage?"
6 March 2021,Awesome,10.0,Besides the first 3 to 2 episodes I loved it. the finale was so amazing can't wait for doctor strange 2
26 June 2021,"Worth-watching, good music, depressed.",10.0,
16 January 2021,Bewitched meets Life on Mars,3.0,"If these two tv series had a love child, it would be Wandavision. I'm only two episodes in and holding out hope that the story improves dramatically but thus far it's not been good.

If you aren't familiar with Bewitched, this is a sitcom from the early 60s that starred a witch (Samantha) and her ordinary husband (Darren). Shenanigans ensue. The style also resembles the Dick vanDyke show. Wandavision nails it but sitcoms have evolved so much in the past 60 years, it feels dull.

Life on Mars, on the other hand, is more recent and there's a version in the US and UK. That story follows Sam, a detective from the 2000s, who is hit by a car and falls into a coma only to wake in the 1970s. In the 70s, he works as a detective but there's no modern forensics, suspects are beaten, no cell phones, no modern interrogation techniques. The similarity here is that occasionally Sam hears voices from his real life (such as through the radio or TV). Is it all Sam's imagination? Did he actually travel back in time? Will Sam wake from the coma? The show leaves the audience to wonder giving just the occasional clues.

Life on Mars is a great show and a trope that is usually successful (such as with 12 Monkeys). However, in Wandavision, it's sorta ruined by the dorky 60's sitcom setting. Unlike Pleasantville, another similar example of this, it's done in a very campy and unfunny way.

I certainly hope it improves but unless there's significant character development in the rest of the cast, this show is not going to be very successful."
5 March 2021,A NEW LEAP FOR THE MCU,10.0,
2 April 2021,"Keep going through the 1st two episodes, it definitely gets better",8.0,"So, this is the first web series made by Marvel Studios, but this is not the first marvel tv show. Very well rated shows such as The daredevil, The punisher exists, but they are not part of the MCU. So, This is the first show to be part of the MCU.

The premise of WV starts just after the Avengers: Endgame, where people have blipped and again came back after 3 yrs, but some never did and never will. One such is Vison. Now, in the aftermath, Wanda is completely devasted for her loss and thus she creates a reality where she alters everything to the level of atoms. She even traps real people in a fictional storyline playing in a loop. This is the HEX, where most of the things happen.

The first 2 episodes might seem off to some because of their presentation. These are completely black and white and are of a 4:3 aspect ratio. Also, these episodes lead to more questions than answers. But, after the third episode, it comes back to what Marvel does best. The soundtrack, the action, are of a typical Marvel movie, nothing less. After that, it has magic, the best character development, action, twists, and everything that u want from it. At its core, however, this a Wanda Only Show. It reintroduces Wanda as a character as an Avenger, and people will care for her. It develops Wanda as a character, establishes her as Scarlet Witch. It is a story about her sorrow, her wrath, her power, her love, her will, and ofc her magic. It has a full episode that can and will make you emotionally dedicated to only Wanda. It also has a solid villain character. Who is the villain? - well u are left to speculate that as did we. The character development of the antagonist is also pretty solid. The finale is also good enough, but here I have to say, it didn't click for me. We had certain expectations, which flourished not because of some rumors or anything but because Marvel themselves hinted at some events through this show itself which are quite huge to be true. But to use them as mere props disappointed me. That is the only caveat in this show for me. Also, the ending wasn't the best. It could have been better. It left too many questions unanswered. Now, I get it some movies will come to answer them. But it fell a little off. So, that's it. If u want to watch marvel movies further u have to watch this show. So, go watch it anyway."
25 January 2021,An original entry in MCU,9.0,Very promissing show with many easter eggs a nice mystery wrapped up in a sitcom package. Be patient and aenjoy the ride.
15 January 2021,Made an account after years of using this app to leave a review for this show...,9.0,"Seeing everyone trash this show on a first impression is heartbreaking for me and is an insult to the people who put time and effort into this project. Of course any project that comes from creative genius is going to be off-putting to some but people have some self awareness. Not every show you're going to get is going to be the glazed donut filled with sugar and sprinkles that marvel and much of Disney and Hollywood shoves down our throats.

Even though this is somewhat hypocritical in the fact that I've only seen 2 episodes along with eveyone else who has reviewed this at this moment in time I beg to differ that my view has some merit in that it is. Ot soley based on the fact that I was ""bored"" and/or ""confused"". If you're bored/confused by the show by only the first two episodes maybe wait a cool minute for the makers of the show to spoonfeed you what it means while the rest of us actually theorize for once. This show is something that creates great bias for me not only in my love for history but as well as personal nostalgia. This show has already hits the high points of classic American television such as I love Lucy, I dream of genie, Dick Van Dyke show, etc. by having the charm, wit, and loveable characters which is central to those old sitcoms.

In addition to this it creates an almost Lynchian environment of intrigue that leads the viewer down an interesting rabbit hole of theory and conjecture. Seeing marvel characters in NEW context adds depth and revitalizes the characters themselves. Instead of reliving the same marvel fantasy with the same plot, villian, music as every of work from the MCU we are given a different, oddball, difficult to interpret work with depth that is ever so present in thev composition of comic books."
6 February 2021,AMAZING,10.0,"I had to admit that I was so confused at the begging, but after watching the next episodes you get the answers and everything is mind blowing."
15 January 2021,Horrible,1.0,What was Disney thinking? They have 5 year olds writing their scripts?
22 January 2021,One of the best miniseries ever made!!,10.0,This is a really amazing show. The pace was a little slow at the start but from the third episode it's catches a good speed. Watching the whole thing is completely worth it!
7 March 2021,The Same Formula but Repackaged,4.0,"Wandavision started off as something new and different to the MCU, with eery notes of The Twilight Zone sprinkled throughout the first few episodes alongside the classic Sitcoms it pastiches.

But as the series goes on, it becomes clear that this is one of the most shallow and vapid attempts to explore grief or mental illness generally.

I've never been so sorely dissapointed in a show that peaked my interest so early on. But ultimately the show was always leading to having a very weak major fight scene between multiple characters, with lots of loose ends.

A show designed to grab your attention, but it's never capable of holding it."
26 March 2021,Next marvel content,10.0,"Best production.

Best actors.

You need to watch this series."
4 April 2021,"Good, but not as great as everyone makes it out to be.",6.0,"Pros: Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda, and Pau Bettany as Vision. Great actors in perfect fitting roles for them.

Minuses: Hampered by being under Disney itself, the freedom of a MARVEL show should be limitless. This feels confined, in many ways from time to imagination itself, to being ""all audiences"" friendly.

What should've been Marvel Studios answer to Black Mirror became a show about a show made by a powerful woman and Avenger who suffered personal losses. This is a theme of the show but its like scratching off a lotto tkt to find it.

Cons: Episodes are too short to enjoy, and the ""charm"" is lost on me. Id have enjoyed it better as a single stand alone movie and then spend the rest of my time watching actual I Dream of Jeannie or Bewitched episodes."
19 February 2021,Can't get thru 1.5 episodes so bad,1.0,All positive reviews are beyond realism. The first 1.5 episodes no plot no intrigue no idea of where it's going. So badly written. To bad.
26 January 2021,"Quirky, but fun.",7.0,Three episodes in and I'm really enjoying this series as it works its way through decades of television in a way that only Marvel can. Definitely worth a watch.
16 January 2021,It's a masterpiece...,10.0,"I think this may be my first review ever. All the negative reviews are harsh and in a way I get it. If you haven't seen or don't follow the MCU, this could be confusing. I should be giving this an 8 or 9 because of it but that wouldn't be fair. As someone who loves the MCU, I was hooked immediately and had to rewatch the two episodes to fully take the whole thing in. It's deep and once it's hooks you... it ain't letting go. The acting was incredible, being able to flip from the carefree storyline to the confusion about what is happening, and doing it so seamlessly blew me off my feet. I actually had trouble remembering at moments that I was watching something with a bigger arc. But then you question everything you just saw. Excellent show and I can't wait for the next episode. I'm loving what Disney is doing by releasing one, or two in this specific instance, episode a week. Gives me something to look foreword to! The writers and actors deserve praise for this because it really is an incredible feat."
26 August 2021,Great!... Except That Last Bit,7.0,"WandaVision is a mini-series with a terrific premise fueled by a story of grief bogged down by an action-heavy finale and a poorly executed boner joke. I really enjoyed how the episodes shifted through different eras of TV to explore different aspects of how Wanda processed Vision death in 'Infinity War.' The exploration of whether or not our main hero is in the wrong is also something only briefly touched upon in the MCU previously and get's much more attention here. Unfortunately, this is mostly set aside by the end of the series for a generic CGI battle that is overall pretty forgettable. Putting aside any expectations of a Fox-Universe crossover or crazy fan theories, it is hard to argue that the series stumbled to stick the landing."
16 January 2021,Couldn't get through 10 min,1.0,It's like watching bad theatre. Super corny and not funny. Not sure what I expected but I thought it would be better than that.
10 February 2021,Bewitched meets Marvel.,9.0,
21 January 2021,Complete garbage,1.0,"I know what they are trying to do, and hey could have done it in 10 minutes. The show is a clone of old black and white sitcoms and I don't know how any sane human can give this more than 2 stars. Anyone who rated this as a ""good show"" needs to seriously get a head examination. Based off the first 2 episodes this show sucks 100%

Just because it is Marvel does not mean it is automatically good. WORST MARVEL SHOW EVER CREATED!"
18 March 2021,Absolutely hands down loved it,10.0,The credits.... I just fast forward. But if you fast forward too much you might miss something along the way 😳😊
5 March 2021,A great show,10.0,Best storytelling by Marvel. Enjoy the wonderful show
13 February 2021,Ignore people telling you to watch untill Ep 5.,3.0,"The series gets 3 stars because of the acting/costumes/music. It is spot on. But storywise, this is a very very VERY slow paced series. The problem is that with half a brain you could figure out the main plot of the show in about 10-15 min. Yet they keep repeating the same ""mystery"" for 4 more 40 min. episodes.

Imagine having to sit through 3 hours of ""mystery"" which has been solved already.

I hope the last 4 episodes will make up for it. If it doesn't, these 3 stars are generous"
15 January 2021,"If you have it a 10 or below a 6, somethings wrong with you",9.0,
21 January 2021,I dont't quite get it...,10.0,"First of all, each episode has 30 minutes or so, with about 10 minutes of credits...a bit to much in my opinion. Second, i don't recall Wanda having those sorceress powers, making things appears, changing dress in an instant, etc. It will all be explained later? Or...? For now, I'm a bit dissapointed, I expected a lot more from this show we all expected for so long."
6 March 2021,Wandavision,10.0,First time writing a review and tbh marvel is the best production company in tv history
26 June 2021,Super creative,10.0,Love the creativity. Love the continued story arch of Wanda and Vision.
6 February 2021,Episode 5,10.0,"At first the show was slow but if you are a true Marvel Fan you will be faithful. And I think Marvel/Disney gave us that back. Bring in Evan Peters was wonderful and made my heart jump. QuickSilver was one of my favorite Mutants and to bring him back was wonderful. Wanda definitely needs that balance, and I hope this brings more to the Marvel Universe. IGNORE the negative comments, read a damm comic book if you feel so negative about the show. Obviously, you haven't if you can't wrap your mind around this concept."
15 January 2021,A Fun Time in Marveland,10.0,"I never expected Marvel to go all-in on the sitcom aspect of this show, but as the first two episodes prove, they have, with great love and attention to detail. An homage to the TV comedies most us were raised watching in their original runs or later in endless reruns, they have done what should be impossible: made it truly funny. Just as in ""Bewitched,"" we know the true nature of this suburban couple, as outlandish as it is, and they use who and what Wanda and Vision are, with a wink to a knowing audience, as a source for their humor. The nature of these characters, serious superheroes in the Avengers movies, is delightfully expanded in their domestic tromp through sitcom tropes. Paul Bettnay is a comedian at heart, and he gets a role here that plays to his wit and shows his deft hand at slapstick. Elizabeth Olsen opens her known range as an actor as the spunky, loving housewife always adorably protecting the couple's secret. It is highly entertaining, managing to be offbeat and yet completely familiar. Enjoy!"
26 January 2021,Takes Time,9.0,"May seem like it's taking awhile to get to the good stuff. But when you think about it, not every tv show is perfect from start to finish. The first two episodes are building backstory with subtle hints at something wrong with it all. I was all smiles all the way through even with the corny jokes. It's honestly a brilliant idea by marvel. You just gotta wait episode 3 really showed some development in the storyline and I expect it to only get better and better from here"
6 February 2021,Gets better every episode!! OMG!!,10.0,
19 February 2021,"Almost gave up on it, glad I didn't",8.0,"I could of turned the first episode off after the first 10 minutes I thought it was that bad, but stick with it because it's worth the wait. First 2 episodes you think are just ridiculous, but they actually tie everything in when you watch the rest of the episodes"
5 February 2021,Marvel is owning now 👌,10.0,Just bang on.. after episode 5.. thrills every moment.Just cant wait till next friday what are they gonna show next.
17 January 2021,25 minutes per episode!,1.0,"Is very clear what Disney is doing. Is making episodes that are only 25 minutes or less! The end result? Save money. Each episode should be 45 minute to an hour but noooooo, disney is way to cheap for that! From now own I am happing pirating all your shows and movies. If you want my hard erned money, then make a proper show that at least 45 minutes per episode."
17 January 2021,wast of time,1.0,"In my opinion, this series is a real waste of time, and the first 2 episodes are to mourn the lost time."
31 January 2021,You can skip actually episode 1,7.0,"Stick around! The series gets exponentially better. Episode 1 wasn't very important (or fun), but I'm glad I watched the trailer and stayed with it. Lots of MCU pieces come together."
5 March 2021,Perfect show!,10.0,This show is literally the best thing that happend in like last two years.
18 January 2021,so far so good.,9.0,"Im a fan of scarlet witch, and this first 2 episode was good. not because i'm a fan. im a fan of inhumans too but after seing their series i feel bored because of many reasons. But WandaVision is good."
12 April 2021,Absolutely Garbage,1.0,"If it takes 4 episodes to make a miniseries passable, it's a failed miniseries. The first episode is unwatchable trash pretending to be old unwatchable trash. I don't want to see the next episode, I hope it stops at one, the universe will worse off with this idiotic show."
20 February 2021,Why all the 10/10 ratings???,1.0,"Scrolling through the comment section, I am astunned by all the 10/10 ratings.This show is dull, insipid and pointless.It tries to create suspense and failed miserably at that.Not to mention the strange quirky style Wandavision takes on.....augggh, just horrible. Do yourself a favour and skip this show!"
7 February 2021,Best after DARK,10.0,Most thrilling series and a the best project by Marvel. Wanda finally got the chance to explore her character .
14 April 2021,Super fun to see!!!,9.0,
21 January 2021,Pretty good (so far) give it a chance,9.0,
21 June 2021,One of the best tv shows of 2021,9.0,"One of the best tv shows of 2021 the theme and the cinematography are on ANOTHER LEVEL.

Good Job Disney."
8 February 2021,"Weird, try hard, and annoying",3.0,Boring and cheesy - I don't what's going on with all these 10/10 fan girls but it's very Disney I guess.
20 February 2021,Good things come to those who wait,9.0,"I cannot understand reviews based on 1 or 2 episodes. You need to get half way through a series before you.can judge it. For the Marvel fans, think back to how Agents Of Shield wasnt very good until after Winter Soldier came out. This is the same. The 1st few episodes are set as a sitcom from a certain age. Episode 1 is the 60s, episode 2, the 70s etc. And their setup is the same as the programs that they are following. There are hints that something is not quite right all the way through, and if you stick with it, you get the pay off big time. Comic book fans just have to think of House Of M. This series is amazing and it's getting better and darker each week. Ignore the reviews of people after 1 episode. Watch it. It's awesome."
16 January 2021,Wanda Vision,10.0,"Curti muito não é a melhor série da Marvel mais é muito divertida, têm uns defeitos ali e aqui mais não chega a incomodar mais a direção é boa as atuações são muito boas! Os efeitos são legais a trilha sonora é simples a história é boa também, Recomendo muito essa série. Nota 8.5"
3 February 2021,Marvel does it again,10.0,Episode 4 makes it a 9/10 but have to go 10/10 because people are dumb
22 March 2021,Incredible experience,10.0,Incredible immersion throughout the decades and incredible acting by Elizabeth Olsen
5 March 2021,Great,9.0,
28 February 2021,Nice Series,8.0,"To all Germans: Who think too that the director Tylor Hayward looks like Markus Söder;) ?

Nice Series. Emmy for Elizabeth Olsen!!"
22 December 2021,Half good Half corny - not bad overall I guess,3.0,"I mean this was interesting and the finale had a great payoff. That I can say.

And how do you not like Wanda and Vision, they do a good job over all.

But the rest of the cast was cookie-cutter and cheesy. The whole cast. Corny lines, looks etc.

Literally the show did not draw me in at all when they were on screen. My only interest was what is going on with Wanda and Vision. After that the rest doesn't matter.

Marvel you need to cast better. You are slipping."
17 January 2021,"Brilliant production, leaves the main question unanswered: Why should you care?",6.0,"Maybe this - more than many other TV/movie productions of lately - needs to be seen in context, as product of its time:

Global pandemic, global ecological crisis, the many social, political and economic uncertainties especially in the US... this may add up to a craving for certainties and assurance in the audience. What else then could be more comforting as a old fashioned sitcom, with old-school humor and recorded laughter?

I think this is the main appeal of the series, and my main reason for quitting it shortly after it had its premiere - I just think there are too many new shows and more exciting concepts out there than to bother with something that was artificially very well crafted and has a beautiful product, but in the end should have been a one-off Xmas Special, not a whole series. The charming ideas do not carry the weight of a whole season and my attention wandered off quite fast.

It's like re-watching The Munsters, or the 60ies Batman - but why should you?

For all those that desperately crave for old wine in new bottles - please go ahead.

For all others: Move along, there is nothing new to see here."
16 January 2021,Wow really?,1.0,"This is complete trash and straight cringe. We waited over a year for this garbage? The acting is terrible, and the laughing in the background is ubearable. I have will not be finishing this trash. I will not spoil anything because my complaints are all spoilers."
25 February 2021,Great show,10.0,The flashback comedy sitcoms are some of the best comedy on tv
8 March 2021,Sitcom solace curled up in a women's grief to eventually scintillate love persevering,10.0,
24 January 2021,HOW ARE WE ALREADY RATING THIS SERIES?!!,10.0,
7 February 2021,wandavision is awesome,10.0,"As a superhero series, this series has a special and new story that I did not expect at all. If I only saw the first 3 episodes, maybe my score would be 5, but now they give full points to this series"
28 January 2021,Wow how surprised,1.0,"I love the mcu and this is poor. I felt sorry for the actors who had to play out this bewitched / Brady bunch poor comedy / trying to be clever series. If people think this is good they must love mcu more than themselves, enjoy it if you can I tried , I tried hard but is cheap unfunny trying to be clever but failed"
16 January 2021,Amazing,10.0,Just watched the first two episodes on Disney plus and my goodness I'm hooked. It's a must watch for any marvel fan.
23 January 2021,Excited to see what's to come...,9.0,"First I have to say, I had no idea what this show was going to be about other than the title characters. My husband and I watch basically everything that comes from the MCU so of course we watched the first 3 episodes all at once. I giggled at the many corny silly double entendres which provided levity during my moments of trying to understand what's going on.

I will say I do love the homage to classic TV. As a kid I would watch I Love Lucy, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched and the Brady Bunch on Nick at Nite (yea this was before tv land haha)...so it's fun to see a modern take on those classics.

Clearly there is something bigger going on and I can't wait to find out what it will be. I plan to keep watching!"
8 February 2021,"If you didnt like it, honey you have a lack of taste",10.0,"I love wandavision, the only reason it has bad reviews is because impatient people cant seem to understand an entire show is different then the first ten minutes. IF you had the patience to watch this then it was made for you, you're lucky to enjoy it. For others who didn't, I'm sorry but i guess that just reflects on your personality... all in good spirit, i LOVED this show, and cannot wait to see the ending"
23 April 2021,Starts of great! But slows down a bit,,"The first 3 episodes are funny, humorous and genius but after it slowed down a bit. Episode 4 was meant to be all serious with no humor and a little confusing which didn't make it as good and fun. It was a plot hole that didn't work out because it was hilarious in first 3 episodes but then it got all serious and wasn't the best acting."
16 January 2021,Y'all are gonna need to be patient.,10.0,"The show would be pretty boring if you got the answers to all your questions in the first two episodes. The stakes are gonna get higher, this is how tv shows work. You're not going to get instant gratification. Watch the whole show before you decide you hate it"
27 January 2021,Enchanting yet unnerving,10.0,"I love this show, Marvel has absolutely outdone themselves, I don't really know why this show has so many bad reviews. This show somehow manages to be happy and delightful yet completely disturbing/unnerving at the same time. I do like how the referenced the old sitcoms as well. Just an overall amazing show."
11 February 2021,Not for fans outside USA,,The title says all. American style sitcoms from 50s/60s/70s are something Europeans don't get it. And I'm sorry but jokes in this show are infantile. I know it was funny those days but it's not anymore. The idea was good but it would be enough to set the show in alternative reality for one episode. Not 90% of the time. WandaVision literally insults my intelligence.
13 February 2021,Good attempt by mcu,9.0,So far episodes are good and unpredictable. This is what mcu should look like
22 April 2021,Boaring 😴,1.0,I found boaring and it didn't make sense. I liked winter soldier and falcon though..
3 January 2022,You can take a girl out of the marvel universe but...,7.0,"Ninety percent intriguing but in the end in order to resolve the storyline we had to put up with the ""get out of gaol free card"" of arbitrary ""superpowers"" which, paradoxically, is what attracts the punters in the first place but always leaves me dissatisfied.

Liz Olsen was good though!"
13 February 2021,Worst posible marvel entry to TV,3.0,"I managed to survive 5 episodes. It's Such a crappy show that I even lack english words to describe how utterly boring and unineresting it is. I gave it a chance, i fast forewarded through episodes but gave up eventually."
30 January 2021,Episodes Short and Credits Long,9.0,"Great show, just watch it. But 30 minute episodes once a week? With 6 minutes of credits? I'll wait a month and just ""binge"" watch it."
8 March 2021,Addictive & Very Well Done,9.0,"I finish all the season at once! In my case, that night I should go to sleep due tomorrow need get up early for work, still I just can´t stop myself, want for more after every episode ends. Finally I finish it and get only one hour only for sleep, still WORTH IT, I don´t regret it at all.

Also, writing, acting and FX, are all well done, Highly recommend."
6 February 2021,That must be the dumbest way to start a series in the history of television.....,6.0,They will have lost viewers by the thousands(like double digits percentages(not low...) of the viewer numbers this series should/could have had) by spending close to 3 episodes on that scare people away start...
15 January 2021,Odd... That's the best word for this tosh..,1.0,"I'm really not sure who this is aimed at?

Marvel fans won't like it? And old sitcom people won't like it? So who will? 🙈

Might get better but first 2 episodes... Pointless in my honest opinion..."
21 January 2021,Odd and Obnoxious,4.0,
11 March 2021,Unexpectedly good,9.0,I went into this mini series with low expectations but all those were turned completely around after the mystery and intrigue started. The mass amounts of tiny details added and small clues made you want to rewatch everything over and over.
24 May 2022,"Started well, but went downhill towards the end",7.0,The first 5-6 episodes were surprisingly good. I enjoyed the sitcom format changing from decade to decade. Very cool intros. But they ran out of gas in the last 2-3 episodes and it became a very generic marvel good vs evil. Too much woke as well.
2 May 2021,makes me mad,4.0,
3 February 2021,Watch it!!!!!!,8.0,First 2 episodes I laughed at how cheesy and fun it was. I couldn't help but think is how does this tie in with MCU characters. Boy was i mistaken episode 3 came and gave some insight and 4 came in with a bang. Complete 360 so invested in this show. Just a bit sour all the episodes are not available for viewing but hey what can u do. Def worth a watch. I took a chance and so should you.
18 January 2021,Hmmm...,5.0,"I think the acting, script and production values are all great. However, I don't think many MCU fans wanted something different. I was looking forward to this show going into it blind. Without my faith in Disney I wouldn't watch a show like this at all. Hopefully it turns in a different direction soon. I really want to like it."
27 February 2021,Masterpiece,10.0,"This show is truly spectacular. First of all, the acting is phenomenal, Elizabeth Owens deserves an Oscar for her performance, alongside all the other actors and actresses. The show is a perfect beginning for Marvel Studios original series, it connects perfectly to all the previous events from the MCU. Now the plot of the show leaves me speechless every single episode. It's so smart with every single easter egg and connections to the comics, witch is a plus for all the original (comic book readers) Marvel fans. Also it presents events that make us learn a lot more about the characters, especially Wanda, and Vision's and Wanda's relationship (witch we hadn't really seen in the previous movies, I mean, not the way they show in Wandavision, at least). At last, this show is so addicting, I literally think about it every single day, coming up with hypotheses about what could happen and that makes 100x more fun to watch. So if you're thinking of watching this show, do it. You'll not regret it, I promise. I mean, if you're a marvel fan I don't know why you wouldn't watch it and if you haven't seen anything Marvel, this show is worth watching all the movies in the MCU to watch it (not that the movies aren't already worth watching themselves, but the connections made with the show make it so much cooler). Anyways, if you read it to here, you can see how much I loved the show."
20 February 2021,good series,7.0,So far so good.already watch 7 episode. its one time watch series.
15 January 2021,It's Actually Good and Funny Don't no why the ratings,9.0,"Why are people Rating this a 3 or a 5 It's a Good tv show that You can watch both With your family and with small children to bring them to more mcu movies.It is also very Intense and interesting and Good and I Recommend it if your a MCU fan Or a person that wants to start watching these types of shows.

Reallly Gooood And Pretty Funny ."
15 January 2021,Weak Start!,3.0,"Weak start for highly anticipated series from MCU. But, it's just 2 episode i still have hope that further episodes will be reveal more story arch to this series. Cringe comedy is the major problem here. I don't blame them tho, 60s comedy isn't for everyone.

I still want to watch this show just because I'm curious where this story going and because I'm MCU fans"
18 January 2021,People there have been two episodes!!!,10.0,
14 April 2022,Baffled by the high praise this received,3.0,"It just wasn't good. Like at all. The first few episodes were an absolute snooze fest. I'd rather watch Malibus Most Wanted on repeat, narrated by Fran Drescher while getting donkey kicked in the bean bag, than watch this again."
20 February 2022,"It started well, but turned out a wizard did it.",,
23 April 2021,Worst Marvel could every produce....,1.0,It is pretty lame till half. Which demotivates you to continue it further.
7 February 2021,Excellent work,9.0,"This show has gotten better with each successive episode, I was a little let down at first with how this show functioned. But after 2 episodes in a row leaving my jaw on the floor, the verdict is in and this show is amazing."
7 March 2021,Thank you MCU 🙏🏽,10.0,"Firstly, thanks to everyone's effort to write a review in the first place. This is my first review (that I can recall) ever. But after doing a 4 months marathon watching ALL MCU movies and series starting with Cap. America and Agent Carter till WandaVision in chronological order, I feel they deserve the credit. So I just finished WandaVision and it is totally out of the box, bold storytelling only Marvel could come up with and actually film it. This review is more of a homage to the insane amount of immaculate work Marvel has put in all their work. Some are very good, some are nearly perfect. And with WandaVision they set the bar even higher. Just watch it, see it through the first 3 episodes and fall in love again in what they came up with this time. Thank you Marvel for again, a new gem in the MCU 🙏🏽"
16 January 2021,What an absolute nightmare,1.0,"Horrific humour, horrible horrible horrible Borring as it gets, 2 out of 9 episodes wasted as a weak, irrelevant show from 70 years back...

What a horror"
20 January 2021,They forgot the golden rule of a series is to make your viewers want to watch the next episode,1.0,"This had me wanting to turn off halfway through the first episode...and I did. It went nowhere fast. No intrigue, no humour, no drama, no action, just a really lame ""hey, let's make it look like a '50s sitcom, you know, like the ones that weren't even funny,"" attempt. Not a smart move, particularly for episode 1. I won't be watching the rest."
2 February 2021,What happened after The Blip,9.0,"After having watched the first episode, I was a little annoyed as I really like the MCU universe. Still, I was curious as the episodes have so many Easter eggs, references to the movies, and the big question: how will this storyline evolve. Now having watched episode 4 I am hooked to see the rest of the season. I must admit: you must have seen most of the other MCU movies to understand how the story develops and the hints to Stark, Hydra, Sword. I therefore give this series a 9 out of 10, as newcomers to the MCU will not understand what they're looking at."
16 January 2021,Creative and different.,7.0,Ofcourse as they do with every other Marvel movie and show the fans will overrate it greatly but it's still worth a watch. It's a different approach from Marvel and it's far from what we're used to seeing from them but it still will make you feel hooked after a few episodes even if it's more like a sitcom than an actionfilled superhero series.
20 February 2021,Gets better and better,10.0,"From the first episode you are wondering what the hell is going on.. stick with it guys.. you are in for a roller coaster of a ride!

The story is unique and it is a refreshing change to the usual boring tv series that are out there with similar plots!

You end up going deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole."
17 January 2021,First Two Episodes are Dull,1.0,
31 January 2021,Rubbish,2.0,"Episode 4 and it's still s h i t. This isn't brave of marvel, it's just poor writing. Legion was brave and weird and 100 times better than wandavision."
28 February 2021,Mind-Blowing,10.0,There are so many questions that need to be answered. MCU is going to next level with this series.
24 September 2023,Only 9 stars and not fully 10,9.0,
16 January 2021,i know its just 2 episodes ...but boring,7.0,"The 1st and 2nd episodes are definetly below average as per my expectation ..in terms of acting and execution they were off the marks ...and we cant judge them with their initial episodes but ..it really lacked exitement or thrill ... the laughing track sure made it look funny ,but it sure wasnt ..and they look to take time to show some action ..but whats the point of watching this period sitcom ...it really eats you to wait for something exiting to happen but just some clif hanger for the next episodes"
27 March 2021,A disappointing end to a mixed bag,4.0,"WandaVision presented the regular audience of MCU with a new ominous mix of genres of sitcom, horror, and mystery. The series began with a 50's sitcom type and proceeded to change the time period with every episode, ending the sitcom-style with something similar to ""The Office"". The first two episodes were bland in comparison to the more interesting middle episodes with laugh-tracks, goofs, mystery, and a lot of questions. The answer to those questions was answered in the middle episodes and a never-before insight of Wanda's life was presented to the audience to resonate with her and her intentions. This mixed-genre was weirdly entertaining but it ended with a rather disappointing finale. We don't really see a lot of fighting or action throughout yet the plot runs swift and the audience discovers so much about the characters. This specialty was dropped ending the series with the all-classic MCU CGI bash. There is nothing wrong with CGI battle endings, but it seemed inadequate to this kind of series. (For example, We wouldn't expect the end of Avengers: Endgame to be the heroes sitting and negotiating with Thanos for a conclusion, do we? This remains the case.)

The grief, sorrow, and emotions faced by Wanda are evident and Elizabeth Olsen's performance should be credited for a lot of it as well.

Overall, the series would be a delight for a regular MCU lad but would remain distasteful for the rest.

4/10."
15 January 2021,I blame the release schedule.,1.0,"Don't makes sense no more. And I blame {{guess what}}.

The series maybe amazing, out-of-the-world, mind blowing, revolutionary, or what have you. However I'm not willing to wait how many weeks for all of it to make sense.

If it was released completely, I would've binge watched it and be done with it.

But releasing just the first 2 very equivocal episodes and making the viewers wait is not something I believe in.

So good luck phase 4."
30 November 2021,First boring. Then great. Then a bland mess.,6.0,"The first few episodes were quite boring to be honest.

However once the ""glitching"" started taking place the story got a lot better.

Then towards the end, with the last major twist, it turned into a bland mess."
16 January 2021,Excellent,9.0,These one star reviewers are morons. The show requires patience & attention. I'm really excited to see where it goes.
8 August 2022,Don't get it,6.0,"Apparently this cost 25 million dollars an episode. Having watched it I am not sure how.

I suspect it would have been a lot better on two and a half million dollars or less. Maybe more script, not so much (many) special effects?

Hitchcock, Lean, Scorsese, Ford-Coppola - maybe story telling is the thing? Maybe an eye, an edit, a cut, a thought, an imagination?"
27 February 2021,Brilliant,10.0,"This show, quite simply, is brilliant. You don't know what's going on the first couple of episodes, but by the fourth, you start to get a handle on things. So many Easter eggs. Every number has a meaning. This show and Elizabeth Olsen deserve Emmys."
24 February 2021,COOL!,8.0,"As a marvel fan,this show is incredible. But for a person who strange to marvel characters.It is a little bit weird. That's all I could say right now. Let's wait for more."
12 May 2021,Just be a bit patient,8.0,"After the events of Avengers: Endgame, Marvel wants to show us more about Wanda Maximoff.(Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision(Paul Betanny). At first i have to admit that the idea of sitcom was strange since i am not into this kind of series but i love the MCU so i gave it a try. The first 3 episodes are nothing like the MCU we are used to, everything is so calm and peaceful and nothing really happens except some hints that create a mystery which slowly unravels. Be patient and u will see that it gets better with every episode , give it a chance and u will be rewarded."
9 May 2022,Best character is Kathryn Hahn,7.0,
17 January 2021,Overrated,1.0,I was hoping with the actors it had that it would have been akot better.
10 August 2021,I love Lucy meets Bewitched,5.0,"Great acting, but the black and white 50's redo is a no go for me. I'm surprised at the high rating. And bc of the high rating I have attempted to watch it several times and it's just not any good. Raised By Wolves was a series I didn't like, but because of the reviews I attempted watch it again and I'm glad I did because it turned out to be a great show, however WondaVision isn't working for me at all."
6 March 2021,Marvelous,9.0,Right from the beginning I was hoping it will get better soon .. Believe me after ep5 things will make sense ...show will get better after each episode And you will find everything connected ... Ending is perfect ...last episode is fill with thriller action and drama I enjoyed what i paid for ...
6 February 2021,Amazing,10.0,"I can't express how much I love this show. It exceeds all my expectations and better than everyone says it is. Ignore the bad review, it's people not giving the show a chance. It's written well and a great way to kick off phase four of the MCU."
16 January 2021,Trust the process,10.0,"So far the first 2 episodes are the setup for the much bigger picture to come. Remember who we are dealing with here and the amazing ride they took us on for 10 years. Marvel knows what they are doing, just sit back and enjoy the ride. It will all make sense in the end.."
16 January 2021,Amazing!,10.0,"I just watched WandaVision and it was amazing!!! I was expecting a great show, But this was way beyond, Can't wait for next episodes! I saw so many questions that are not even worthy to answer, PAY MORE ATTENTION!"
15 January 2021,Meh!!!!,6.0,I was just not so Marvel.. Well MCU could have delivered much better in this one and a half year break.
2 March 2021,"hit and miss, mostly miss",4.0,"I like that they are doing something strange and original. I like the attempt...

I just think it falls totally flat.

The first 3 episodes are honestly pretty tedious to sit through. Corny crappy jokes as they satirize old time TV -- they just drag horribly all for a twist that they could've revealed in the first episode and spared us all the corny walk down tv's memory lane.

It's too much. Way too much.

And the bad joke extends into later episodes too as they go through tv history.

Yeah they capture the various eras well, but so what? None of it is funny in the slightest. It's also very redundant, they basically repeat over and over the same ideas.

They aren't being creative, they're washing rinsing and repeating this over and over and over... and the result is boredom.

And if they were going to write old time tv sitcom, why couldn't they at least do a good job and make it witty -- make it smart. But this is nothing like that. It's intentionally cheesy and corny.

None of this is witty whatsoever. Never laughed or smiled a single time and I'm done episode 5 now.

it's taking way too long to pay off the set ups.

And the pay off isn't nearly as groundbreaking as it needs to be considering the time they make us invest in the set up. The pay off (I won't spoil it), but the pay off is pretty meh. Not terribly clever or anything.

Only done 5 episodes so far -- but I think most ppl reviewing this are being way too generous.

This is not very good nor well written stuff. Not impressed by any of it -- except I'm happy they are trying something unique here.

At least it's not cliche, like most stuff.

When it gets weird, when the creepy pay-offs are the focus, it gets more interesting. But it dallies endlessly and fruitlessly on the lame sitcom stuff...

I think the only reason people are staying on board with this is because it's Marvel.

Vastly overrated IMO. Cannot possibly recommend this."
17 January 2021,Not for non-fans,1.0,"If you're not a fan of the MCU, this is the worst piece of TV in ages. Boring, badly acted, bad comedy.

However, if you are a fan, it appears this is an amazing show filled with a whole heap of background info that drives it forward."
18 March 2021,Deserves to be a movie rather than a mini series!,5.0,"I get that they were trying to be different, but the Scarlet Witch is so damn powerful and deserves more than this series. Elizabeth Olsen's acting is amazing as always in the movie."
2 February 2021,I loved it!,10.0,"I must say this , Wandavision is unlike any other marvel movie or series without a doubt. At first you are confused of what's going on, but in the fourth episode you get a hang of it. Without a doubt the best marvel project yet."
15 January 2021,Best series,10.0,Best show this is comedy show and great Intresting
1 February 2021,It's pretty good,8.0,"It's great Marvel was trying to do something weird and unique, tbh it delivered it great. After a year and a half of no Marvel content they came back strong. These 4 episodes have explained what they are going for. Its great they're doing something different rather than using the same formula for most of the marvel movies. It has flaws but they're not that big or notable. And it's great it's gonna tie in to Doctor Strange and Spider-Man 3. It's good so far not really any big problems."
8 February 2021,Don't waste your time,1.0,"As a lover of all marvel movies, I really tried to like this. I watched ep 1, hated it. started ep 2, couldn't finish it. People said keep trying it gets better, but they are lying. I now watched all 5, and though 4 & 5 have been improvements over the first 3, I find it amazing someone green-lit this trash. Who would agree to start a series off purposely as a bad cheesy sitcom for 4 episodes just to set up the show? Whatever, some people love it, good for them. My opinion is Marvel/Disney + really dropped the ball with this one. Hoping Loki & Falcon/ WS are better than this.

PS- As a survivor of cheesy sitcoms growing up, this doesn't even measure up to those. And the laugh track is horrendous."
12 August 2021,Turned sour by the marvel formula,6.0,It's fine. I really enjoyed the first few episodes due to it's tone being so unique especially for the MCU. Loved the way it called back to old sitcoms and took a new approach to that format. What was so captivating about the show was how it didn't follow the marvel formula and that's why the later episodes were really bad. They introduce one of the worst villians in the MCU and eventually that mysterious tone is completly lost. The answers that the show gives to the questions it set up are so underwhelming and the last episode is possibly the worst in of them all. Endings are important and WandaVision does not have a good one . It starts of good but it falls victim to the marvel formula in the worst way which leeds to it being just okay.
8 April 2021,Starts slow and weird but well worth sticking it out.,8.0,"First 2 episodes I was thinking what the hells going on then it kicks in and it gets well good. Loved it, great storyline too.👍🏻"
16 January 2021,Excited for more!,10.0,I was very excited for this and waited months for it! I literally turned it on as soon as I got the notification. It is very good and the concept is great. I am only disappointed that it was only 2 episodes though. Hoping for more soon.
23 January 2021,"HahahaHahaha, so funny this show is.",3.0,"I didn't make any search on it and I thought this sitcom thing was temporary, never taking the jokes serious. God, jokes are awful. Series only interesting when it is serious. I am going to watch it only to find about what is happening and just because there are no good shows right now."
29 January 2021,Don't let the first 2 episodes dissuade you,8.0,NO SPOILERS! But the first 2 episodes are really out there and one may have no idea what's going on. It's a slow burn. Episode 3 is much better and episode 4 is awesome!
22 February 2021,Top!!,10.0,"This show is very good and only gets better and better! Marvel is simply amazing, can't wait for the final episodes!"
22 August 2021,Surprisingly Great.,8.0,"I literally had zero expectations on this one, but this turned out to be great. It gave a sit-com as well as a thrilling emotional experience for sure. It scored in lots of areas, especially creating the suspense and intense among the audience. Surely, after watching one episode you won't stop until you finish the whole series. TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT ."
18 January 2021,Bored and Sad 😥,2.0,"I was really looking forward to seeing this as I am a huge Marvel fan and the 50's sitcom idea is really original, what let this down was a very slow moving storyline and not enough tidbits about the obvious mystery as to why Wanda and Vision are there to engage me.

I will watch the next installment but if its as bad as the first 2 episodes I will give the rest of the series a miss."
23 January 2021,Interesting...,9.0,"Uh, wow. This is really cool! By the second episode they have established really interesting things,no spoilers, and the third episode is the best yet. The reason it's not 10/10 is because it is a little slow at first."
13 April 2021,Artistic bravery,5.0,"Let's start on a positive note, the two leads are fantastic and very convincing.

The concept for the show is brilliant, fresh and original.

So?

Well, Disney did not have the balls to stick with it and starting episode 4 went back and reverted the show to a well known mcu formula.

I guess it is what Marvel fans wanted, I mean all those that failed to see that the first 3 episodes actually were the best, so Disney gave the majority what they wanted I guess, but artistic bravery and integrity sometimes means NOT giving the fans what they expect.

A tragically missed opportunity, so gave 5 out of 5 stars for the first few episodes and everything after zero, as it was a cop out.

It's not that I mind the concept, but the way they got from A to B was way too fast and unsubtle. It would have been way better to actually play it like a sitcom and let the uneasyness creep in slowly at certain points and actually make a more interesting explanation.

Ah well, I'm obviously a minority, but still, kudos to the actors, tremendous job all around, kept me watching."
10 February 2021,Get past the first 2 episodes and this is gold!,10.0,"This show is a slow burn and may seem goofy based on the first 2 episodes, but STICK WITH IT! This show is awesome and a total link to the next movie!! It's gut wrenching at times and shows how broken someone can be when they lose their world..."
24 January 2021,This show just proves how different modern audiences are from that of the 1950's,8.0,"I'm not sure what people were expecting but if you watch a trailer you would know this is supposed to be a sitcom (at least for now) not an action packed super hero show. Fans of sitcoms especially older ones like bewitched, or I love lucy, will enjoy this. You can tell this show is going to change a lot as this season progresses. If anything this show is hopefully the beginning of a great era of marvel trying new things and not just the same formula over and over again"
8 February 2021,Funtastic!,10.0,"We are loving this show. As huge fans of the Marvel movies, we are really enjoying WandaVision. At the end of each episode the four of us (Hubster, myself and our two sons) discuss different points we felt were explained and how there are so many more questions needing answers. We are thrilled with the addition of a particular Agent Jimmy Woo and Dr. Darcy Lewis!!"
1 April 2021,Confusing for non Marvel fans,6.0,"I liked this series but too often was I confused by what was happening on screen. I'm not a Marvel fan, but I watched it because everyone said it was a great show. It would have been better to maybe explain more through the show for non Marvel fans. I think I would have enjoyed it more if this was the case.

The acting was great and I liked the sitcom based ones. That made it more enjoyable."
17 January 2021,Too slow so far after the first two episodes,5.0,"Yeah, I don't know about this one. Maybe it will get more interesting in later episodes, but so far after the first two I already feel like they have stretched the concept too thin.

It feels like when other shows sometimes does a scene for laughs in black an white, with outdated jokes and an over the top laugh track, except instead of just one 2 min scene, it's been two whole episodes so far. As a result I struggled to stay interested halfway through the first one, constantly waiting for something other than just stale jokes to happen.

Judging by the trailers they will keep this very slow roll-out of a reveal of what is actually going on, but in different eras, and I am afraid that it will be too slow. Even though every episode is barely 25 min, I feel like it would have benefitted a lot from only have one episode per era, and have the characters realize that something is wrong much faster and then move on to something more interesting."
12 February 2021,Bad decision Marvel,3.0,"So the first 3 episodes as many have mentioned are cringeworthy. A bit of a combination of the tv show Full House and Everybody hates Raymond. Why bring out this garbage? As some reviews have pointed out in order to tie the story together, but why write it like this, they could have written any story but they decide to copy tv sitcoms from the 70's for the first 3 episodes. They even film them in black and white... Not what you would expect from a Marvel 2021 production. What they didn't have enough money for color? No some will argue they did it very cleverly to depict episode 1 as 1960, episode 2 is 1970, episode 3 is set in 1980, episode 4 is 90's syle, episode 5 is 2000, ep 6 then looks like 2010 and that's as far as I've gotten. I am not impressed casting the episodes like this. If I wanted to watch bad tv shows from the 60's I would go watch bad tv shows from the 60's instead of watching episode 1 which is worse than a bad 60's tv show as it tries to copy a bad 60's tv show."
16 January 2021,Promising show with an interesting premise,8.0,"I feel like 90% of the negative reviews, need to take a break this show is obviously leading to something. It has a very 50s sit-com ascetic with some ""Truman Show"" vibes. There's more at play then what's at the surface of this TV show. I think this show will be higher rated by the end of the series and a lot of people will like it's fresh choices. I think the 50s look with a kind of big brother vibe is neat. It's not putting me at the edge of my seat but I like the juxtaposition of a cheerful sitcom with a conspiracy theory-esk not everything is alright type of show so I'll hang on. If you're on the boarder of picking up this show, then just wait for more episodes to come out. What you hear through cultural osmosis will either interest you or turn you off. I do think this show has a cool concept and look forward to where it'll go especially with two less popular MCU heroes. I am excited for them to get fleshed out more as people. Age of Ultron didn't really do them enough justice."
29 March 2021,Heartthrob,10.0,"The series started with some comedy but soon everything started unfolding and everything started to get connected.

Once you start watching there is no way to go back.

The final 3 episodes are terrific and very interesting.

Also, the song Agatha All Along is the bop song of year."
5 March 2021,Marvel is back,10.0,
15 January 2021,Still waiting,4.0,"Well maybe they want to make something difference, but for me episode 1 & 2, bored. Hope not in next episode."
16 January 2021,Developing too slowly,2.0,It was the most dull and boring show I've seen in the last 5 years! Background laugh tracks are irritating and the real behind the scenes story develops tooo slowly for anyone to be interested in future episodes. Seems like the real backstory can be made into a 10 minute clip if all episodes scenes are stitched together. Won't have much of a significant influence over your understanding of future marvel movies if you miss this series.
16 January 2021,What the crap,1.0,Without doubt the worst programme in years. Credits take up achunk of time. Nothing makes sense. 22/24 minutes long. Really bad story line. You have to be an encyclopedia of Marvel to get what it's about and even that's a strain. Wherever this is leading up to would want to be huge.
18 January 2021,Wish i didn't download this nonsense,1.0,"I was so excited to see this when i heared the name of serie, they use the name and good characters to produce the boring sitcom of all time not the exciting SiFi. this is not creativity guys this is bad taste scarmble eggs"
29 January 2021,awesome,10.0,Marvel always does the best.this time its not different awesome
17 January 2021,very slow first 2 episodes,1.0,"I was expecting a gradual unfolding of the story into the marvel universe but the first 2 episodes show nothing more than a bad remake of 1945s ""Bewitched""."
14 July 2021,A very decent show,7.0,"I loved the cast, and the acting was exceptional, but the story was a bit of a reach even for a Marvel title. I admittedly expected much more after all of the hype I've heard. Don't get me wrong; the show is absolutely worth watching if you've already got Disney+, but it's not enough to warrant a subscription on its own.

I enjoyed the concept and the sense of mystery throughout the first few episodes. I liked the stylistic theme, the buildup, the intensity, and felt like each episode transitioned very well into the next. With all of that said it still felt a little flat and empty compared to the core material of past Marvel titles. It didn't quite have that oomph I was expecting and honestly felt a bit empty towards the last couple of episodes.

Vision was exceptionally played but his presence and self awareness don't coincidence with the plot. I loved Rambeau as a character but I feel like they could have given her a much better foundation to go forward with. Billy and Tommy make no logical sense on any level. I still don't understand where Agnes even came from or if that was just a total coincidence. There are more than a few plot holes concerning characters even after seeing the series finale and I really felt like they could have done so much more with the talent at their disposal.

My biggest gripe is that the old feeling is gone. This a isn't a Marvel title; it's a Disney title, and that feeling is very palpable. That's the impression I get from all of this freshly written Marvel material and I worry that this trend will continue. The golden years are definitely behind us."
8 December 2023,Way better than I expected!,10.0,
16 January 2021,Terrible,1.0,"Terrible. Slow, unfunny and pointless. Watched for 15 minutes with 2 teenagers and switched off. Understand Disney want to go in a different direction, but this is so far from anything offered before, that it really needs a new banner, not the Marvel one."
16 January 2021,What did I just watch?,7.0,"This has to be the most ridiculous thing I've ever watched. Who is giving this anything more than 1 star? It's not entertaining, and it's taking way too long to get to the point. Don't waste your time."
2 December 2021,Powerful start -- let down at the end,7.0,"Watching the first episodes I thought ""Finally something different from Marvel"" and I really hooked up, especially after X-Men quicksilver showed up.

Loved Kathryn Hahn as Agatha, she was the highlight of the series. The show let prospects for so many things , but the end was a huge let down with poor cgi battle and didn't justify in full the presence of Agatha.

Anyway this was a good attempt of Marvel to start producing different things. They have the characters, they have the source material, they must do it in order to keep the audiences interest."
22 January 2021,Puzzled,2.0,"Idk what they are going for with this show. No action in the first 2 episodes.....very boring and uninteresting. Sorry Disney you really confused me with this one. Additionally, I am AMAZED at all it decent reviews it has. So far, this show is a snoozefest."
14 August 2021,what?,1.0,Barely managed to watch the first episode and just hoovered over the remaining ones. What the hell is this???!!!...what happened to the MCU? And i thought that Loki was bad when this is miles off charts. Disney managed to screw it all up what has been previously built in over a decade. Shame!
22 July 2021,Perfect!,10.0,"I loved how marvel could mix the two genres!

Elizabeth Olsen finally had more importance in the MCU with her Scarlet Witch role, and she did an excellent job!"
10 March 2021,Who on earth is rating this so highly?!,1.0,"Theres a reason the 1950's sitcoms stayed in the 1950s. I get that there's some 'mystery' we're supposed to keep watching to solve, but I'd rather watch paint dry than this cringeworthy junk. Huge shame, because I love both Paul Bethany and Elizabeth Olsen in everything else."
22 January 2021,Spectacular and a breath of fresh air in the MCU,10.0,"I am thrilled with this new path for the MCU. Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange are my favorite characters. People that are trashing this are close minded and doesnt appreciate how visionary and extraordinary this can be for the future of Marvel. So many fantastical stories to be told. The show's setting, writing, custome design and background are top notch. Give it a try. It almost nostalgic"
8 May 2021,Marvel Studios can do anything!,9.0,"This little project proved once and for all that Marvel Studios is a lot more than actors quipping and fighting alien armies. The first 3-4 episodes leave you baffled but are really appreciated once the story comes to an end.

Who knew this Studio can portray complex emotions. Kudos."
17 January 2021,Worst from MCU.,2.0,"It takes a lot of hard work to be so bad when the list contains Captain Marvel. The jokes donot work, the tone neither. And the suspense and horror quotient will come towards the end of season 1. By then it will be too late."
7 February 2021,So far amazing,10.0,"My first review and this show is very good, some people didn't like the first 3eps and judged so fast but I found them perfect and then ep4 and 5 where things get exciting and I can't wait for the rest of the eps"
24 January 2021,Amazing,10.0,One of the best shows I have seen a a LONG time! It's a a great return to the MCU and the newer episodes bringing more and more of stuff fans of marvel will love
5 March 2021,So good. I want second season.,10.0,
18 January 2021,I was expecting more from marvel its definitely disappointing,6.0,It was the most ridiculous series i have ever seen no story not funny or interesting so it basically shows how white people living with actually no story its just not include something that will want you to keep watching it.
22 January 2021,It's okay,6.0,I thought it was okay. I'm not that big of a fan though. (Btw this is only for the first 2 ep) I wouldn't give this a 1 or a 3 because I see a lot of people saying this. But a 6 is a good score. It can be quite boring and most of the jokes are just flat out not funny. But the acting is quite good. The visuals make you feel like this is a 50s sitcom. It's not that bad.
18 February 2022,"Amazing start show, mediocre ending",7.0,
21 February 2021,Boring,1.0,"I think Disney is loosing it with Wandavision. The show tries to be funny and serious and the result is something without one thing nor the other. I really liked Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage and was hoping Disney+ could re-take them. After watching Wandavision I'm disappointed and understood that is never going to happen. Disney+ is more children oriented. Is a little bit sad watch what's they are doing with the MCU in Wandavision. I really hope next series will be better."
28 January 2021,A Marvel nerd's paradise,10.0,"I can't lie, this show is weird, but if you are a marvel fan and know even a little about scarlet witch from the comics then you're set. There are so many hints to characters from the comics that we haven't met yet. On the outside it looks like a cheesy Bewitched rip off, but when you think about why this world exists and why it might be crumbling apart, you can see the genius behind the writing. It's supposed to mess with your mind and make you think. If all you see is 50's American sitcom, you're not paying close enough attention."
12 August 2021,Boring.,3.0,"I love Paul Bettany but this was just meh, the ""funny"" parts were meh, the ""plot"" was meh, the poor attempt at golden age sitcom was meh and the acting was meh only good thing was the cgi which is why I gave it 3 stars. PLEASE MARVAL F off with all this TV shows, give the people a break."
27 May 2021,Worst Show I have ever tried to watch,1.0,Not one of these good reviews is real. Literally the worst show ever.
25 January 2021,WONDERFUL,10.0,Different does not equal bad. This show is amazing.
26 February 2021,Stick to this series..,8.0,"The first few episodes are very confusing, hundreds of questions will pop in yout mind and you might lose interest. But, I guarantee you that your view about this series will completely change after the 4th episode. Marvel studios have tried to do something unique and it will surely meet you expectations from Marvel."
26 January 2021,Wow,1.0,90 minutes of my life I'd take back. Possibly the worst beginning to an MCU series ever. Should have started with something badass to reel in viewers and then with this boring nonsense.
12 April 2021,Watch until the 4th ep before giving up,9.0,"During the 1st 2 episodes, i was confused as hell what was going on and how this relates to the MCU, but from the 4th episode onwards, it was awesome. Glad i didnt give up half way through the 1st ep like i was about to. I would rate it higher but the 1st 2 eps did make me want to quit watching but the entire thing is still easily a 9 out of 10 for me."
15 January 2021,"4 star, but only for Paul Bettany.",4.0,"Been waiting for this to be released and wow what a huge disappointment it is. The 2 episodes so far are a disaster and have had no really story to them. Paul Bettany is the only reason I watched the 2nd episode as he is the shining star in what is a massive disappointment to the franchise. The CEO needs to have words with Kevin Feige over this, dare I say maybe even time for him to step down and let someone with passion take over."
10 March 2021,I head start in a unique direction for Marvel,7.0,"Wandavision tries to be a unique and drastically different show, by using old sitcoms, but soon falls flat as the old studio formula pops it's head up once again. It is a smart and wonderfully written show, up until the moment the writers are put back on their leash. And ending is just bad."
15 January 2021,Question mark,,"Who on earth signed this off!?

I don't understand the appeal of this whatsoever. Am I missing something?

Couldn't even finish the first episode what a let down!"
14 January 2022,Creativity on a time limit,6.0,
25 January 2021,"Unique, Creative and Thrilling!",10.0,This is a complete masterpiece! Everything is trailing off so well. Episode 3 is my favorite so far! I love the develop of each scene and how the writer honors important character traits and storylines.
15 January 2021,A show that will tease you to the very last second of every episode and I wouldn't want it any other way (kinda).,9.0,"Scarlet Witch/Wanda is my all-time favourite comic character and this show does her justice. Massive fan of Elizabeth Olsen as well. I've only seen the first 2 episodes but can only think of 2 things I wish could have been different (But I realise is more up to Disney than the creators/writers). Firstly, it would be great if this was R rated to give more of the ""Get Out"" type psychological thriller vibe (Which they wouldn't do because it's Disney). Secondly, they could also make the episodes longer if they're going to be releasing them weekly instead of all at once. Apart from that, I have nothing to complain about and can't wait for the next episode!"
15 January 2021,So far so bad,7.0,The first two episodes are in black and white with an old school aspect ratio. An unnecessary gimmick that is sure to alienate a lot of viewers. This is clearly a transparent attempt to cut production costs and also fulfill contractual obligations of a particular no of episodes...I hope the coming episodes has quality CGI that rival the marvel movies...
28 January 2021,I love it!,10.0,"I'm probably a bit biased, because I love the characters Wanda and Vision and I'm a sucker for sitcoms, so do bear that in mind while reading this. Okay, so far there have been three episodes and I'm in love. There is great acting, great sets, great costumes, and great hair and makeup. I love every intro! I love the funny sitcom jokes. I love the commercials. And I LOVE all the Easter eggs!! There are sooooo many. It is fantastic and I cannot wait to see where this goes. I really don't get why so many people are harping on it. I think it's great. I will admit it is slower than usual Marvel movies, but that was expected. It is supposed to be different. I honestly really enjoy that it isn't so action packed. So, all in all I'm in love XD!!"
27 February 2021,I never . . . .,10.0,"I never seen this series like this before.

The MCU its getting bigger and more bigger then its already was."
17 January 2021,Disappointing,2.0,"First episodes are only about being a parody of bad jokes at the 50's, also the credits wastes 7 minutes for episodes of 30 minutes. This doesn't feel like Marvel, just Disney... I hope they don't do this to the other series coming"
28 April 2021,Get's good,6.0,Great tv series! It's a little slow in the few first episodes but it really gets better.
13 March 2021,Don't believe the negatives,10.0,It's one of those shows you have to punch your way through the first couple of episodes but once it's revealed you'll enjoy ride. It's really very clever IMO.
14 September 2021,AVOID this and dont waste your time. What a load of.. total garbage.,1.0,"Until now, ive always believed imdb´s ratings, if a movie got 8/10 or more, its been excellent. Even 7/10 movies are ok, and some 6/10´s too.

I downloaded all WandaVision episodes to my phone, planning to watch them during 5 hour flight. After 1st episode, i was like ""what the h** is this?"".

Perhaps it will get better, and started episode 2 - well it didnt. Half way through 3rd episode i was so mad for wasting time to this garbage that i immediately deleted all content, id rather watch the rest of the flight some airplane walls and dig my nose than spend another second with this rubbish.

Never been so dissapointed after seeing Marvel logo, next im going to cancel my Disney+ subscription for good."
6 February 2021,A great comeback for marvel cinematic universe,10.0,"Well-written, well-scripted and well acted. Watching the transition between sitcom periods on an MCU piece nonetheless is genius and oh boy do the MCU side characters shine in this latest entry."
13 March 2021,Epic,10.0,"L hve never commented on the IMBD but this is serie, is is one of the most creative things l hve ever seen in the movie industry"
7 March 2021,This is how a Marvel show should be!,9.0,"What joy to get to watch this! Marvel keeps showing how it should be done. If you are an MCU fan, simply a must watch!"
6 February 2021,"Great show, getting better Each episode",9.0,"A lot of people have been giving negative feedback and didn't really enjoy the first 3 episodes of the show or thought they were boring. I for one think they were a great buildup to episode 4 and 5 which are a lot more like MCU movies. Creating this kind of show as a start for phase 4 was a really risky move from marvel's side, however it definitely pays off. Make sure to watch the latter episodes and not just judge based on the first couple of episodes."
31 January 2021,you rock mcu!,10.0,Yea i love the show since ep1 and clearly it's not for those people who only wanna watch the action scenes xd🤣 keep up the good work marvel we love you!
11 February 2021,Really enjoying it!,10.0,"It's funny, intriguing, and marvel'ous! Hang on till eps 4 and you'll be hooked for good."
15 January 2021,A Delightful Slow Burn,10.0,"I appreciate the big swing the MCU is hitting by going all in on the classic sitcom style. I couldn't help myself but smile throughout these two episodes. Elizabeth and Paul have amazing chemistry and have not lost a step since they first joined the MCU. Right from the start, you realize that Westview is not what it seems, and I couldn't be more excited to go on this ride. The TV commercials we're such a pleasant surprise with clever nods to Wanda's past. I can't wait to see what is in store."
15 January 2021,Will anything remotely interesting ever happen?,6.0,"Thinly recycled Pleasantville premise barely worthy of a Marvel short, let alone a series. Two episodes in and were no closer to knowing why they're stuck in this reality. How long do they think they can string us along? At this rate we won't find out until the inevitable cliffhanger final-episode."
6 March 2021,Great show but a couple of misses,8.0,
15 January 2021,Are you serious indeed!,10.0,"Straight up 10, if you're rating this anything below 8 I think you should crack on watching reality TV ;)"
22 February 2021,RATE THE EPISODE,10.0,I dont know how they rated the series when the two last episodes are not on air
16 January 2021,Not an important review,8.0,"I'm not saying anything about the plot because I haven't seen the whole first episode yet.

BUT

I've watched an unhealthy amount of 50s television in my life and I have to point out a few tiny things.

The voices... Or perhaps the way they're recorded aren't right. I understand our speech patterns have changed in the last 70 years, but you have to understand that 50s television shows were often based on radio the shows that preceded them.

See, actors and actresses perform differently when all you can experience is their voice. They over expressed emotions vocally to make up for bot being able to see their faces. (Check out some old radio shows. They're incredible and entertaining.)

So when television became a thing, radio moved over to television. It was an incredible new opportunity for old radio shows, but there was a problem. The fans already knew what they sounded like. They would be turned off if their favorite characters all of a sudden were completely different than they remembered.

So the actors simply kept up their radio voices. In my opinion it made for more immersive television, but my opinion is neither here nor there.

My point is that if you want to parody 50s television, you also have to parody 50s radio. Their voices aren't quite right.

Anyway. Thanks."
20 March 2021,Don't believe the hype.,4.0,
19 January 2021,"Extremely Weird, Extremely Intriguing, and Mildly Funny",8.0,"Marvel is truly taking a risk in this show and going way outside the box. It is pretty incredible to see all of the work that they put in to replicate these sitcoms throughout the decades. Overall, I enjoyed the sitcom itself and had some laughs along with wondering what the creepier reality really is."
28 March 2021,Wandavision it's so great,9.0,I love when wanda transform in Scarlett witch. I hope white vision can meet wanda again.
16 January 2021,I Love Lucy 3rd grade Knock off insult to Marvel Universe,1.0,
15 January 2021,God damn you people are dense. This is like the most meta show ever. Am definitely intrigued.,10.0,Feel sorry for the people that actually believe that this is just a 50s sitcom.
5 February 2021,Great show,10.0,Ignore all negative reviews before episode 4 because episode four really shook stuff up and made the other episodes better and more important
6 February 2021,This show was a blast!,9.0,"The show was AMAZING! I just think that Americans love binge watching, and If Disney releases all episodes at once, they could get a rating above 9 :)"
14 February 2021,No spoilers review,9.0,Marvel proved again there capability with an interesting story
27 February 2021,WHOA!!!!!!,10.0,This show is downright amazing I won't lie the first two episodes I was quite worried as to where this show was going Then episode for a completely takes off in ways we had only prayed could happen Marvel and Disney have finally become creative genius is in the show us proof of that
17 January 2021,Don't rate it after the first show,10.0,"The first show is quirky and weird. Yes, it is like a 50's TV show. Yes, there is a strange laugh track. Yes, the story seems banal. Just bare with it - it is just the set up. Imaging judging 2001 A Space Odyssey after just seeing the simians!

By the second show you realize something strange is going on, and this mystery is going to be slowly revealed to us. This is a very intriguing concept - and it has me hooked. The actors - even the secondary characters - have all been great. Bravo Marvel. Bravo Disney."
19 February 2021,Expected much more than this from the 7th episode.,9.0,"Too short, Kevin feige siad that last 3 episodes will be of three hours combined but this episode was just 24-26 min long. The end was again a cliffhanger but providing just an half hour content after waiting a week is just crime."
3 March 2021,best mcu project,10.0,"Best MCU project i've ever watch. brilliant, top notch story telling"
12 January 2022,What a fiasco!,3.0,"Pointless, followed by poor storyline, wooden acting from Elizabeth Olsen, she can be so much better. Paul Bettany is okay, Teyonah Parris and Randall Park shine, Kat Dennings is always beautiful but they had her still doing 2 Broke Girls. So lousy writing, and since it's a director's medium Matt Shakman needs more education, less budget."
27 February 2021,Great,10.0,Awesome show Just ignore negative reviewer they're action lover
17 February 2021,Bad cgi,1.0,"Just a bad kids tv show.

Disney made starwars into nothing but kids stuff.

Now thay take Marvell and ruin that 2.

But it is a smart move business wise, but I am not going to waste my time watching this."
5 March 2021,Over hyped nonsense,7.0,
10 April 2021,Cheap like a 90s TV show,5.0,
10 February 2021,Nice,10.0,Nice series not but not easy to understand easily the stories. I m big fan of marvel and liked the series very much. Waiting for more episodes
27 January 2021,Simply Amazing!!,9.0,The series is simply amazing. It opens new pathways for the MCU and excitement to the entire Marvel fan base. Acting and screenplay is amazing.
20 February 2021,Surprisingly amazing,10.0,"As a longtime marvel fan, I rolled my eyes when I heard of Wandavision. Eventually, non-MCU fans pushed me to watch it and I've been so incredibly impressed!"
19 January 2021,Very nice,10.0,It is very nice and different. I am very intrigued
21 January 2021,Awful show,1.0,"Not much I can say really. Struggled through the first 2 episodes and oh my lord what a load of rubbish this show is. Boring, not engaging, characters are awful. Won't be bothering with the rest of the season. Don't waste your time!"
23 January 2021,This is a rating for episodes 1-3 (so far),6.0,"An interesting gimmick that would have been ok in the first 20-30min of episode 1 ONLY! It has been going on for all three episodes! IF the series gets better, will definitely be recommending skipping the first episodes."
23 January 2021,Marvel disaster,1.0,"I love all marvel films great action and enjoyment. This is the opposite silly and stupid , what have marvel done!"
26 March 2021,Inconsistent but enjoyable,6.0,"The SWORD arc is unnecessary in this series, it only distracts from the most important character arc - Wanda's. She is the heart and soul of WandaVision. Sit-com concept is one of the coolest in the MCU, unfortunately left behind to show us another SHIELD. Why? Wanda is a witch, she does magic, why would I want to see soldiers in this series? Episodes 7 and 8 are outstanding and the first 3 are cool because of the sit-com thing but the rest is ok at best. The finale disappoints. I don't know what to think about the series. I really want to love it but its flaws are clear and could easily be avoided. Overally, I think WandaVision is inconsistent but enjoyable and it certainly is worth a try!"
17 January 2021,No ExPlOsIoN MaKe DuMdUm SaD,10.0,"Honestly, this is such a masterpiece already, and those saying it's boring clearly haven't got any patience or just aren't paying attention to what's happening, or just sadly don't understand..

It's incredible.."
6 February 2021,Amazing delightfully!!!,10.0,"You have to trust everytime in Marvel, since the 1st episode it was charming and then started to become in a masterpiece as usual...."
26 February 2021,Get past the first 3 episodes,8.0,Once you get past the first 3 episodes this is a very good show. You can tell the show has a big budget and Elizabeth Olsen is beautiful and very talented. For me the top of the mountain for a Superhero show is still Daredevil. But this series has the potential to be a close second. I am looking forward to see how the end plays out. Anyone who likes Superhero shows you definitely need to check this one out.
29 March 2021,Overrated,5.0,"Marvel was doing great with daredevil and other Netflix series those series were 100 times better than these new series , ps just expecting them not to spoil the Loki series."
11 March 2021,My personal review!,10.0,
28 February 2021,Glorious show,10.0,This is one of the best tv show's that I've ever seen
1 February 2021,Just remain patient.,8.0,"This series has started to pick the momentum. In the first 3 episodes, I felt a bit confused and annoyed, as there was hardly 2 minutes content in a 30 minutes episode. But suddenly, it exploded into life in 4th episode, and every minute of previous 3 episodes started making sense. A special thanks to Canadian Lad ( a YouTube channel), who kept series interesting during first 3 episodes. It is a proper follow up after Hulk's snap in Avengers Endgame. After that , I am eagerly awaiting further Marvel series on Disney+. My only reason for reducing 2 stars is anger with Disney, as I felt Disney+ should have released 4 episodes in the first week itself."
16 January 2021,Boring,1.0,"Very bad 50's sitcom parody absolutely nothing of interest in the first 2 eps, don't know what it's supposed to be about I don't think it does either! If it's trying to ""set"" something up to draw you in it has failed miserably, can't see many people sticking with it to see how it plays out, which is a shame as I was looking forward to it, at least Loki looks good."
17 March 2021,How does anyone actually like this show,2.0,I've honestly never started a show and stopped midway through episode 2. This is easily the most pointless and boring TV show I've ever watched. Nothing happens. The attempt and humor is just not funny. There is no point to anything. And honestly who cares about scarelt witch or vision? Horrible show and shocked anyone watched it past ep 2.
15 January 2021,Biggest dissapointment ever,1.0,"I love the entire Marvel franchise. I have enjoyed all of their movies and series and I think Vision and Wanda Are brillant characters.

But this is is just asbolutely horrible.

This show has nothing to do with the characters you know. It is utterly hopeless."
4 October 2021,Over-rated dross,2.0,"Well this really is a disappointment. The writing is inconsistent, contradictory and at times simply incoherent.

For example, the ""Salem"" witch (and don't ask me why she is even introduced, apart from the need for a nemesis) explains that Wanda has no power in the lair as this was created by her spell, however later during their battle throughout the town the witch has all her powers; until Wanda decides to point out that the town was created by her spell and so the witch has no power there. Excuse me? Is this the same witch who has been ripping the town apart in her battle with Wanda for the last 10 minutes?

And the above is just one example. It really looks to be written by a committee (and one with limited collective intellect at that).

The acting is leaden, to the point of being cringe-worthy.

And the special effects just ho-hum.

All in all, a cinematic embarrassment."
28 February 2021,Not what I expected but still fun,7.0,"You will be distracted by a lot of subplots that apparently make no sense, but slowly it will start to build up to a more satisfying story."
16 January 2021,I'm really enjoying the first two episodes,9.0,People are just weird about the fact they hate a brand new show so much. Let it ride out a bit more before you throw all the 1s around
24 February 2021,Absolutely Creative and Brilliant!,10.0,Hands down to this Marvel TV series! Well thought! I love the story line and the characters are perfect. Everyone should watch this.
22 March 2021,The Dick Van Dyke Show With Superpowers,3.0,"It is even in black & white! Well, at least the first episode was. I couldn't watch the reruns of The DVD Show anymore, I had them memorized, so I'm not interested in the revival of the scripts. What happened to the days of a Pilot so we can see what it will before they make an entire season? If you like this, go watch Dick Van Dyke & see it again; for the first run. Marvel is broken."
16 January 2021,Really painful to watch,1.0,How this has a good review? It's painful to watch it...nothing like a real Marvel... So disappointed.
18 January 2021,"So far, it's incredible.",10.0,Im getting Truman show + MCU + sitcom vibes. I think it's gonna be good. And the show made me like vision.
15 January 2021,Off-putting and disconnected. A failed attempt (so far) to reinvent by Marvel,8.0,"After watching the first two episodes, I find myself in an odd discomfort.

The only thing to which I can relate my experience with WandaVision thus far is as though someone has given me a dirty martini, but instead of olive juice, they used soy sauce.

While it is salty, the more you sip the more you feel ill and know that its just not the right mix...

Marvel explored different formulas in the past with great success (Guardians, and Taika Waititi' s Thor Ragnarock) but it doesn't seem as though WandaVision is following suit. I hope WV gets better, but if the first two episodes are truly the consistent path forward, this is a show on which I will personally pass.

Update: patience is a virtue. Updated rating from 1 to 7 This show is getting very interesting and more in line with what to expect from marvel. On the path to yet another dynamic edition to the Marvel portfolio. Looking forward to continued viewing."
15 January 2021,NEVER EXPECTED THIS FROM MARVEL PERFECT SITCOM🔥🔥,8.0,"This is review for starting 2 episodes

Great narration, they will make u laugh clearly and convincingly

Wanda and vision out performed their characters

The only thing made me to reduce the 2 stars is for end credits, because in first episode they took whole 5 minutes for end credits in 30 minutes, so it sucks.

Great in starting episodes, perfect kissass start let's hope that whole seasons will be like this"
5 March 2021,Wasted potential,5.0,"Was good. Good story,good acting, decent action. But it was sooo close to great but fell short. As it had to potential to do soo much more,introduce soo many loved characters. Not trying to knock the Monica Rambo introduction too hard but it's a comic character nobody cared about or asked for. Mephisto however wouldve great. Or the house of M story line introducing xmen. That wouldve blown my hair back. Or the ""engineer being Reed Richards introducing the Fantastic 4. But it felt like mostly filler when all was said and done."
5 March 2021,This could have been a movie with what little was done,1.0,
27 February 2021,It's one of the greatest shows to have ever existed,10.0,"I'm not saying that just because I'm a marvel fan. I've loved Wanda from the beginning but I wasn't so sure about this series. But oh my godddd!! It's a slow burning series with twists coming up from episode 3-4. And it is absolutely breathtaking. The acting, the idea, the Easter eggs in every episode, the characters...the emotion....it's just out of the world. Watch it if you haven't. The only problem is that the episodes are too short. Well done MCU"
6 March 2021,Amazing,10.0,
31 March 2021,Trying to get past episode 3,5.0,"One of the slowest starting TV shows I've seen. I'm really hoping it gets better. So far, it's getting 5 stars until it picks up."
17 May 2021,A great start for mcu phase 4,10.0,A very decent series loved it ignore the bad reviews it is such a great series you should watch this I watched this many times and it never bored me not like falcon and the winter soldier.
15 January 2021,WTF!!!,,"I am a BIG MCU fan and have just watched the first two episodes. Frankly, they may be the two worst TV series episodes I have ever seen. The dialog is written as high camp, with every performance done the same way. The faux laugh track is intrusive and laughs, themselves, non-existent. The biggest waste of money, ever, by the once impeccable Marvel Studios. Like my title says; hey Marvel, WTF!!??"
5 March 2021,Waste of time and money,1.0,This show barely did anything.. waste of time and money. Barely and setup for future movies or storyline. If the show didn't exist it would have no effect on the overall marvel universe
15 January 2021,Very USA targeted,1.0,Will give it time and revisit my rating..... if need be?
5 March 2021,One of the best series of the year,10.0,When i saw the first triler i thought its not going to be good but marvel did it again
15 January 2021,Marvellous,10.0,"This is the bestest series ever. It contains a lot of fun, entrainment, mystery and romance. And wandavision is awesome."
15 January 2021,A Perfect Show,10.0,"No Doubt That Marvel Is Master Great Show And A Perfect Confusion Disney made Great Shows Like Hamilton,The Mandalorian And Now WandaVision Keep It Up But some People are Trying to Give Hate Even They Did Not Saw The Episodes So Humble Request To Stop Unwanted Hate By The Way Great Show"
15 January 2021,Kind of boring,5.0,"So, maybe it is to early to give a good review, but man, the two first episodes were quite boring. If this were a new franchise, I would not spend any other minute for it. But lets hope for the next episodes."
25 February 2021,"Didn't expect it to be this good, but wow!",9.0,"I'm more of a fan of the action filled MCU stuff, so I didn't expect expect this show to be my kind of thing, but I was blown away after the first two episodes.

The humor is great, each era that the show covers looks very realistic and Paul Bettany and Elizebeth Olsen have better chemistry then they do in the movies.

The show feels like Marvels take on Stranger Things, and I think it's ultimately a good thing that it doesn't follow the typical MCU formula, it makes it feel fresh and exciting."
8 March 2021,"good show, but missing something",9.0,"When i started watching this show i got obsessed on episode 2. but i feel like it left to many plot holes, so many questions were not answered. i get it was just a mini series but i really expected more. but marvel did a awesome job picking actors, the actors they choose did a phenomenal job on this show. i definitely recommend this show, i'm not saying it's bad OR good or it's more like in the middle. that's my honest review"
9 March 2021,Nice,9.0,"Well, one of the best an amazing one!! All the episodes are amazing. the charcters are one of my favorite one."
13 November 2022,"Liz Olsen is a risen star, but Disney's MCU is fading...",7.0,"Liz Olsen and Paul Bettany are wonderful, especially when they are together. Agatha is entertaining-that wink! This is a hard to beat Disney+ MCU show compared to the others for several reasons...it's the first MCU show of its kind, it has good actors as leads, it took a giant risk, breaking away from the Marvel formula, and WandaVision progresses as a new decade of TV history, starting with the 1950s, for each of its own episodes, which was creative and enjoyable. Nevertheless, it is still a flawed show. The biggest problem with Disney Marvel is its ideology, which infects its character motivations and morality message. Wanda was wrong to hold an entire town captive to hold on to her own (false) reality of a happy family. You cannot justify such actions as moral or even excusable if you're going to be consistent. Wanda might justify them, but we the audience should not. What she did, no matter how justified she felt, resulted in the torture and suffering of hundreds of people, so she could escape her own grief. Yes, Wanda is broken. Yes, she is traumatized. Yes, she's been through so much that almost any normal person would crack under the grief and pressure. Yes, the chaos magic she gives off is sometimes outside her control. Yes, it was Agatha all along manipulating her. Yes, there are outside forces against her. However, Wanda ultimately made the choice to choose her false comfort and her imaginary family over reality and the freedom of others. This show also set us on the downward spiral 🌀 of the rest of MCU Phase 4-""dealing with consequences and grief."" WandaVision, at times and with nuance, showed Wanda struggle with the morality of living in her dream world at a community's expense, but in spite of all that, there still were other times where I felt the overall POV was sympathetic towards Wanda to a fault. I do think the showrunners were attempting to make Wanda's demise a sympathetic tragedy, but it didn't totally land either bc it was too quick to shift the blame off Wanda's choices as an individual, mainly through how other characters responded to Wanda. Vision's response made the most sense until it didn't. Blaming everything else that brought her to that point of crisis was not a good take. Her situation and surroundings forcing her to choose the wrong decision was not acceptable. We know this because now hundreds of other people are damaged by her pain and grief. Wanda didn't make a sacrifice to set things right. She's not brave for what she did. She's a tragedy. She gave in to her own grief. She's not a hero for doing that. I can sympathize with her, but I shouldn't admire her either. If she were a hero, she would have made things right sooner when she realized that she was harming and controlling an entire community. Instead, she stalled and made excuses to be with her family. She stayed in denial and deluded herself. While this makes for an interesting story, where the morality message fails is how other characters respond to Wanda's actions. They should've not let her get away with what she did and been so dismissive. Peeking into the aftermath of this show with Doctor Strange 2: MoM, we see that the creatives at Marvel felt what Wanda did for her family and her grief was partly justifiable and ""reasonable,"" according to Dr. Strange-""You set things right in the end."" No, she didn't. Very bad choice-bad morals, motivations, and consequences. Doctor Strange should have challenged Wanda for what she did, given her a clear consequence, and the Vision should have also, which we sadly still haven't seen such a resolution between Wanda and Vision. What she did ultimately was wrong, and the message should have showed the audience more clearly that Wanda was becoming corrupted by her own desires, her own pain and grief, and later the Darkhold/witchcraft. I guess Dr. Strange 2 attempted to give us consequences for her actions, but within WandaVision the show itself, the consequences didn't fully make sense or weren't fully realized."
16 January 2021,Bad really really bad,1.0,A black and white cringe show Waste of time Dora x flora is even better than this I watched 1st episode that was very bad and cringe I hoped 2nd episode will be good but that was too bad very very bad
14 February 2021,Credits,9.0,Love the show and seeing where it is going but can anyone explain why we need 7 minutes of credits for every episode
5 March 2021,Don't give into fan theories.,10.0,"I enjoyed the show, to the point I was tuning in on fan theories, I think that was the play on why the finale was so lack luster to some people. Never set your expectations too high or you'll always be let down in the end. I however thought it was a great way to start off phase 4 of the MCU, and am curious how Wanda will play into Doctor Strange 2 now that her powers are being explored to the fullest."
9 June 2021,So...,8.0,"Fun but VERY overrated. The sitcom part of it is pretty boring, especially episode 1 & 2."
16 January 2021,Lack of stakes means the audience doesn't care,2.0,"This show does a good job of recreating the feel of old sitcoms, but it is unengaging because the only thing driving the story is the mystery of what is going on. And we rarely get clues. The self-contained stories in the first two episodes have no stakes. If their neighbors figure out that Wanda and Vision have superpowers, nothing bad will happen because everything is happening in Wanda's head in any case. So, we just don't care as we watch the dinner party and the talent show. None of it matters, and none of it informs the question of where Wanda is in reality."
3 February 2021,It escalated quickly,10.0,
30 January 2021,"Just...boring, and frustrating",3.0,"Yes, I get what they were going for with this show, I just hoped for more and better, but so far, several episodes in, it's been a straight terrible ""comedy"" show revolving around the most boring MCU characters with a frustrating allusion to a long-con, which may be fun when revealed, but mostly amounts to frustrating and aggressive scenes that merely serve to intentionally confuse the audience. If you like comedy based upon people just being in somewhat awkward situations, without any actual relatable, or clever, scenarios, then this is the show for you."
25 September 2021,Unwatchable and pointless,3.0,
15 January 2021,Give this a chance.,10.0,"No show is going to immediately give you action, and everything you want straight away. We have to experience the story with Wanda and Vision. Don't vote a show down badly because you haven't got everything you wanted straight away. If you did that then films would be rated so much lower than normal. You have to wait."
15 January 2021,Loved It!,10.0,"The first two episodes were very good. The show itself js very unique, will update the review as more episodes come out."
19 January 2021,AWESOME !,10.0,"Finally ! 'MARVEL' created something unique and special. This 'SITCOM' reminds me of the show - 'Mr. Bean', which I loved to watch in my childhood. NOSTALGIA ! I just can't wait anymore to watch next episodes."
15 January 2021,"Top billed cast, and hilarious representation makes it an overall package.",10.0,"Phase Four in the MCU is set to roll hilariously as Disney+ releases two episodes of the new Miniseries/Sitcom WandaVision, starring Paul Bettany as Vision and Lizzie Olsen as Wanda Maximoff. Episodes are set to be released every Friday, totalling 9 episodes, out of which two of them have already aired. Looking forward to the next episodes eagerly and hopes are set high after watching the first two episodes."
6 February 2021,It really isn't that good... Seriously it's getting too much hype,6.0,"I've just finished ep5 and as much as I am enjoying it, it is a little dull... Yes it's new and different but to be honest, it's not that creepy, not that twisted and far too much sitcom for me. I want a little more action than what we are getting. I know some people will argue the action is yet to come. But I don't want to watch 7-8hrs of sitcom to get 2 hours of action....

I would even go as far as saying most of the episodes are forgettable, like filler episodes until the big bang!!

Im gonna keep watching but so far I can predict I will much prefer falcon and the winter soldier."
20 January 2021,Great so far,10.0,An amazing celebration of classic TV and I can't wait to see where this goes
15 January 2021,Intriguing,10.0,Don't listen to anyone saying that it is boring. Sure it's slow sometimes and different but it's a build up for sure and with that it's so entertaining to see something fresh happening in the MCU and the first two episodes are so intriguing.
16 January 2021,If I want to see Bewitched I'll watch the real thing.,5.0,"I loved the treatment, the retro atmosphere impeccably recreated, the lighting, and the good intentions... but I must admit that, nostalgia aside, this was painful to watch. I got to catch many details hinting something big underneath the silver facade but it just did not cut it for me. Paul is not a very charismatic guy and the pace of these two first episodes do not help you get interested in what i asume must be a big shocker ahead. That being said, I did not hate it, there is quality in the making but I just hope this gets better soon, not for the fans who loved it but for many of us who love MARVEL but not necessarily in a blindly way."
18 January 2021,My first thought was,9.0,
7 February 2021,Anyone who thinks this show has been good is just afraid to go against the norm.,1.0,"It hasn't been funny. The story is moving at a snail's pace. No cool superhero stuff has happened yet. No cool villain has emerged yet. With the exception of episode 4, one could argue that all the episodes have almost been exactly the same.

Snooze fest so far. Zzzzzzvision"
17 March 2021,WandaMeh,6.0,
15 January 2021,It's ironic that people who are giving 1/10 are calling people who give 10/10 sheep,10.0,"I can't believe you are rating it without seeing the actual events in the series. Giving 1/10 is worse than giving 10/10 in my opinion. Your reasoning is the main reason here.

PS: I rated because I didn't know how to write a review without rating. I will update it when i finish it."
13 March 2021,I loved it,10.0,"The story telling ,vfx, ester eggs, comic book reference all was great."
21 February 2021,INCREDIBLE,10.0,Amazing funny Brilliant beautiful show with incredible actors a must watch for all mcu fans and newcomers 10/10 would give it more if I could amazing
16 October 2021,Quite intressting,5.0,
18 March 2021,"Disappointing, waste of time",3.0,"The story is filled with plot holes , the evil man has no motives or even a reason to do that ( at some point i thought they just did that to protect wanda from being the bad guy ) Even wanda could just make vision body alive again without mindcontrolling the whole city First 4 episode were fine but after that it became very bad"
15 January 2021,a very good start to phase 4 of the ucm,10.0,"A very good start for phase 4 of the ucm, wandavision promises to be a very innovative product of its kind, the 2 chapters seemed very good to me, the series promises to have a great ending. believing that they will continue down that path I give it 8 stars."
15 January 2021,Unique and fresh,10.0,The mic comes back in the most refreshing way possible with this show
30 January 2021,Hang in there. It gets really good.,9.0,"Just hang in there, the odd beginnings get explained and start to tie in to the MCU. Knew this was going somewhere and I'm excited now that it is. Lots of tie ins eventually."
24 January 2021,Good Acting x Terrible Script/Idea Still = Rubbish,1.0,"I dont write many reviews but feel I must throw in an opinion here. I am an avid comic reader of 40 years and love the MCU but this just doesnt work. Its hilarious when you read reviews that are basically saying, if you dont get all the easter eggs/between the lines info, and rate this a 10 then you are basically thick. Also who wants to rewatch anything to pick up what they miss the first time around. Is Tenet the new standard for entertainment. If this is a ""House of M"" type project then I cannot see how it can work. The comics version was complicated enough and you could reread till you got it. No way that translates to the screen. Disney has let some eccentric fanboys run riot."
5 March 2021,"Started in a really interesting way, fell back to more of the same",7.0,"I consider myself an MCU fan - I've enjoyed pretty much all the films and rewatch my favourites periodically. I thought the first few episodes of this were exciting but in a totally different way to how Marvel films are usually ""exciting"". It was unknown territory they were treading, the mystery was unfolding slowly and the setting was extremely well done, with detail commendable.

I didn't mind the episodes which departed from this as they were necessary, and to start with the mystery was still being unravelled in an interesting way. It was the penultimate episode where it fell apart for me. The good was thrown from the window and the makers ignored their previous 'Show don't tell' storytelling, going full on predictable Marvel film. I also felt a level of cringe I haven't felt before in a Marvel film at a certain Agnes flashback at the beginning of the penultimate episode.

To sum up I thought this was an incredibly fun show to start with, and it did remain quite fun. The new original direction was exciting, but unfortunately it fell back to the same old tropes, big fights, structure and uninspiring dialogue a Marvel film can have. I suppose it always was going to be that way, but the end goal we were told was to set up the next Dr Strange film. It felt like a very generic way to do that as much will have to be explained in the upcoming film. We get a resolution of sorts in the finale, but the payoff felt underwhelming, uninteresting and I think it did a disservice to the wit and creativity of opening episodes."
20 January 2021,Dire,1.0,I can usually put up with most things but honestly after 20 minutes I gave up.
28 January 2021,This is the best,10.0,"This the best series i ever watched. This show making more thrill by every episodes. Easter egg, Easter egg every were in this show is Easter egg. This show is mind blowing.."
5 September 2021,waste of time,1.0,"This is boring and a total waste of time. Also I am not giving it a 1 it's a 0 actually but there is no button for 0,so?"
21 January 2021,Could it be worse?,1.0,"This is absolutely terrible. If you find this entertaining or even watchable, I would seriously question your judgment, mental health and/or motives for saying it is good."
5 March 2021,Lost me at the last hurdle!,6.0,
16 January 2021,A black and white cheesy stoned producers trip,1.0,"What is this? A superhero show as a cheesy 50's sitcom. People say that we have to be patient, it's a premise. No. A premise is like 5 minutes not 2 episodes on a total of 9! If this is really the show, it's a total flop if it isn't, still a flop. Don't make me loose my time with 2 episodes of something it isn't (a Marvel superhero show). One of the worst thing I watched on fast forward, imagine! Can't understand people giving it good reviews, must be paid trolls."
15 January 2021,Big disappointment,2.0,"It is like waiting for Godot. Not really anything moving. Tended to fast forward to when there would be a plot twist or anything for that matter. And then the titles started rolling... Long time waiting for some content but in vain... Paul Bethany does have the comedy skills, so not a 1 for the review."
16 January 2021,Not super hero quality at all,1.0,Wanda and Vision are badass super heroes not something out of a comedy. I wanted to see them use their powers to fight evil not wash dishes and do paperwork. I can't believe this came from Marvel and that the actors agreed to do this. Very disappointed MCU...very disappointed!!!
22 January 2021,Absolutely wonderful,10.0,"Anyone giving this a 1 star needs to get off reality tv and appreciate the classics. This show is amazing, I wasn't expecting it to be about anything and I found it incredibly funny, witty and charming. We are huge fans of the Marvel Universe and I love how original this is. It clearly takes bits from Marvels past, what's to come and tv history. It's beautiful. Can't wait to watch more."
11 January 2022,Complete Waste Of A Compelling Storyline,3.0,
20 July 2021,Points for creativity but...,5.0,"Not a fan of most of the shows they imitated, so not appreciative of applying their cheeseball-factor to the Marvel universe. The first 3 episodes are basically throw away... or the point could at least have been made in 1. Kat Dennings's character was the best add overall from other storylines, in my opinion.

The whole thing gets tedious around episode 7 and ultimately, the story didn't pay out for me... on to Loki!"
12 February 2021,Fresh take on Marvel superheroes.,10.0,"Being the diversity of styles we loved in the comics to the MCU WandaVision is a beautiful homage to pop culture, comic books, and television in general. Plus an under plot that comes closer to the surface every episode til you can't help but rewatch it all until the next week."
9 February 2021,Great Marvel Show! But Kat Dennings is horrible,8.0,The show is very entertaining and I want a new episode to come out every day!! I could watch 20. The only bad part of the show is Kat Dennings. She is so so annoying! Its unbelievable. Her voice is cringy and acting is bad.
5 February 2021,Amazing!,9.0,"As someone who enjoys the MCU but is not a die-hard fan, I thought I'd lost interest after the undoubtedly epic and fantastic Avengers: Endgame.

After watching WandaVision, however, this has changed: The show got me excited from the first minute, as it is not (what I feared) a typical plot following the Marvel formula, but something that feels refreshing and mysterious, which is exactly what we need.

Unlike others, I also really enjoyed the first two episodes, as I love how they build up the plot: It brings up questions and delivers a mysterious atmosphere throughout every episode.

I recommend watching this show if you also enjoy the MCU and may have felt the same way. It brought me from losing interest to being hyped for Phase Five!

Hats off to Kevin Feige and everyone that is involved in this show!"
16 January 2021,Worst show ever,1.0,Don't waste your time. if you are sitecom fan then this is for you only
17 July 2021,Love it,10.0,I loved this show whit 2 happy episode but the end is so sed.
16 January 2021,not worth to seeing,1.0,WHO the hell gives this high ratings. These are the most boring and pointless two episodes I've seen.
1 February 2021,To much novelty and unclear story backbone,,"A good series or movie needs a relatable or at least understandable storyline as backbone. Here it was not clear for me at all in the first 3 episodes what anything meant and therefore basically a waste of my time. It was not even clear who the protagonist is, and I am still not sure about that."
16 January 2021,Pathetic,3.0,"Simply doesn't work in this premise,couldn't be further from the films! I get the idea behind it like in the same sort of casting as ""Bewitched"" etc,I found it to be a missed opportunity without doubt! It's like casting ""Loki"" in a babysitters role!"
26 February 2021,It's everything I hoped for and more,10.0,I look forward to a new episode every single week and each episode just gets better and better. The acting on all parts is amazing and Elizabeth Olsen deserves an Emmy for this
21 March 2021,Garbage,1.0,Let's make a show about the 2 dumbest and most boring characters in Marvel.....
15 January 2021,SPECTACULAR! MARVEL MADE ANOTHER GEM FOR THE SHELVES,10.0,"GO WATCH AND FIND OUT. MARVEL REALLY WENT A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WITH THIS ONE BUT IN A VERY SMART, SUSPENSEFUL, AND WEIRDLY FUNNY WAY"
17 January 2021,It's simply Awful,2.0,"I understand what their going for, and I see where they want to be. But so far in these 2 episodes it's nothing, but a waste of time there's so much unused Potential. I hate the speed of the show And there's nothing worse than seeing cringe worthy corny jokes. It's too bad I had to wait so long to see this. I'll continue to watch to see if it gets better but so far it's not looking good."
16 January 2021,Two eps in,8.0,"It's like a cross between Bwitched, Pleasantville and the Truman show. Only 2 episodes in and wondering what's going on."
7 March 2021,Now that we've seen the whole series,7.0,"Safe to say this show doesn't really find its mark until episode 4 but from then on in its pretty freaking awesome. If you're expecting a big marvel payoff that opens doors to all of phase 4 you might be little disappointed as they shunt most of that for a more character drive storyline which, I appreciated. Overall really enjoyed the series. Probably would have appreciated it more if I could have binged it rather than having to sit through the first two weeks and 3 episodes that are all setup and do little to drive the plot but now the whole thing is up and people can do just that."
31 May 2021,The first 3 episodes were the worst,2.0,I have seen many b&w tv shows. Marvel purposesly made every minute so painfully cheese when they could have made them entertaining. They threw some color mystery scenes into the non-existing plot which I get were necessary but they inexplicably wasted so much air time it is hard to understand how people still give the series a perfect review. It was average at best. They could have cut the first 3 episodes and the series would have been fine. Or something like Back To The Future were somebody goes back in time to try to change it. I suspect some Marvel fans just blindly love anything Marvel ever makes.
20 July 2021,"Started great, built up suspense only to waste it all with ridiculously stupid plot holes and climax",3.0,"So many plotholes I cannot even count. When it started it felt really great until the middle-to-ending

Especially that episode where they walk through her flashback and the villain has to talk and explain everything. Felt like a disney show for children

If you have to explain something with monologues then it's bad writing, period.

The ending was so bland man, I don't even feel like expending energy pointing out all the flaws. Cliche dialogues too and plot devices that has no place and are only there for fan service. Marvel needs to shelf all 3 of W. V, Falcon & WS and Loki and needs to hire Netflix's Daredevil writers for it's shows."
5 February 2021,Not for attention span voids,10.0,"Like agent's of shield this show is excellent just need some patience! It's unlike anything I've seen comic book wise and definitely spices up around episode 4.

If you're invested in the MCU watch it!"
19 June 2021,Read it rather than watch it to save yourself time,1.0,"Probably the worst display of the marvel universe so far. The plot will definitely become interesting. But they dragged on a simplistic plot over the course of 9, 45 minutes episodes. Almost 7 hours. The villain was disappointing, the cause of why it happened was dull as well. Only thing interesting is the overall aspect of how it'll fall into next phase of marvel."
1 March 2021,How do so many people enjoy this?,1.0,"I don't know if I have ever hated a show as much as I hate WandaVision. I can't stand laugh tracks. I really don't like the MCU in general. I hate old sitcoms. To be honest I don't think I ever had a chance with this show. I find it cheesy, boring, and straight up painful to watch. Several of the characters are downright annoying, and the plot is beyond confusing. It's the kind of show that requires a ton of knowledge about comic books (which I don't like) or spending hours watching all the MCU movies and reading conspiracy theories online about whether there will be 9 or 10 episodes. Who has time for that crap? Honestly, the fact that Disney can successfully convince an entire generation of people to gobble up another trash series just by dragging it out for suspense and throwing fanfare at it speaks to the cunning marketing of the company. Or maybe it just means people are sheep. Either way, if you love Marvel, comics, and old sitcoms, then this is a very elaborate and well put together show that you will love. I can respect that. But for the vast majority of viewers who have been obsessively raving about this show, what are you doing?? I guess I just don't like to be told what to think."
16 January 2021,Perfect,10.0,How.. i mean how is people giving this show less than 9.. this is my first revies here ever.. and i have no idea what drugs people are taking. Something most be going on in here.. is it the dc fanboys that are bombing these reviews or is it somtehing else.. beacuse this show is good.. only 2 episodes in and im hooked.
13 February 2021,Boy! It just keeps getting better,10.0,"With every episode WandaVision brings new excitement to the table, given the bad reviews that people started writing after just watching first 3 episodes and BTW the follow up episodes completely justify the first 3...👍👍👍"
16 January 2021,"So bad! Made Zero sense. No plot, Zero explanation. I hated it!",,"This review is for the first two episodes. Will it get better? Well, I'm not giving away any more of my life to find out. Who thought that would would be a good idea? This was the single most painful thing I have forced myself to watch in years.

Drab and boring beyond words. It was so bad I thought I was watching something from the DC universe. And even then that's an insult to every bad DC movie. There is good different and bad different. This is the latter I'm sorry to say. Do yourselves a favor and skip it. Unless your enjoy shows that are open ended and don't explain at all what the hell is going on and trying to ""pay omage"" to old shows that are off air now for a good reason. Knock yourselves out. I will be placing Wanda Vision on the metaphorical shelf next to the star wars Christmas special where it belongs."
26 January 2021,This review is for the first 3 episodes,10.0,
20 August 2021,"Slow paced, but great ending",7.0,"Ending of a show really matters, even if you don't remember what happened in the whole show you'd definitely remember the ending and for me the ending was 10/10. Even tho the ending was 10/10 that doesn't change the fact that the series was slow paced for the first episodes. Don't get me wrong, I loved the show but in my opinion if it was a bit more fast paced it would have been way better. Marvel showed us they can make a 10/10 series in 6 episodes through Loki I seriously wish all episodes were as entertaining as the last ones."
30 January 2021,Different!,10.0,"Just when I thought that all good ideas for shows/movies had already been done & redone a million times, this show came out & suprised me. The only negative thing about it so far is that I have to wait for each episode to be released. At this point only 4 episodes are available, &I have watched each one multiple times."
27 January 2021,A mysterious new world,8.0,"At first glance I considered the possibility that the town & people within may be victims of thanos & the ""blip"" but that was quickly dismissed after Ep.1... The mystery alone of wanda & visions true location has kept me entertained & wanting more. The expectation of action has taken a backseat to the hows & whys surrounding this story...the strange behavior of the neighbors, the possibility that they may know the ""truth""....the possibility that they may not even be real...I LOVE IT! My only concern is that we may not get any real answers in the 1st season. Someone IS watching these people....BUT WHO?!? I can't wait to see more."
19 January 2021,Can i turn the color back on?,,"Good or bad whos to say. i skipped ahead eventually switched it off, no thank you. If you read these reviews you would thinks the people writing them have some sort of agenda. They praise the show beyond belief even though they've only seen the intro essentially, One dedicated a paragraph praising the credits. The words magical and shinny were used. Just sayin. Take a chill pill don't hate but don't glorify either. Whatever bye"
16 January 2021,Only reviewing episodes 1 and 2,1.0,I fell asleep. I understand what they tried to do but it failed. Will see how the series develops.
23 January 2021,Indulgent and tedious,2.0,"3 episodes in...

I understand it's an idealization by Wanda, of her relationship with Vision that she can never have (can't keep track, but he's dead right?) within the the framework of classic sitcoms. But it doesn't mean I'm finding it entertaining, and it certainly isn't art!"
19 January 2021,Disappointed,1.0,"Waste of time, Totally disappointed for first two episodes not gonna watch further of this"
23 July 2021,.. it made no sense?,7.0,.. she's too powerful already .. way too powerful .. then why not take on Megatron and save Optimus Prime? But no .. better things to do ..
30 January 2021,Great series to explore these characters further,10.0,"The ones complaining about it please go and read some of the comics and maybe it will all make more sense. You don't know anything about Wanda and Vision origins, powers and capabilities if you complain about the approach of this show. I think it's creative and hope will give the attention Wanda and Vision characters deserve! Looking forward for more"
22 January 2021,DON'T LISTEN TO HATERS!,8.0,"I don't know what these haters expected? Did they not watch the trailers? It's like they are expecting thanos to show up and start fighting everyone. People who are giving bad reviews only started watching marvel around infinity war, and don't care about the characters and only care about action..... but yeah it's an amazing show!"
16 January 2021,The cyberpunk 2077 of the marvel universe,7.0,"Wow...such a no good, terribly bad, disaster of a tv series. It's like they tried to rip off Plainville and The Truman Show, but forgot about the twist and decided to just make I Love Lucy. Very disappointing."
19 March 2021,Worth the hype - and way beyond!!,10.0,"A brilliant fresh take on the MCU with so many twists and theories. I enjoyed all episodes, but after episode 3/4 is where it gets incredible!! A genius series!"
19 February 2021,"If you're a fan of Marvel, watch this. Avoid if you have a tiny attention span",10.0,"I'm convinced some of these exaggerated poor reviews are from people with some kind of attention deficiency. They need action from the beginning. I will say it doesn't dive into the meat of the story until a few episodes in however, for me personally the mystery is what keeps me watching. If you're an impatient individual, I suggest waiting until the entire series is released. Now the only reason I give it a 9 is for the long credits. The acting is amazing and I love the way they go through the decades of sitcoms."
14 May 2022,Very well executed!,10.0,"The format of the first three episodes and how it evolved to show what is truly going on is just masterpiece! If you plan to watch Dr Strange 2, watch this first!"
9 April 2021,Promising but turns into the usual low quality superhero plot,5.0,"I'm not a fan of superhero movies or anything superhero, mainly because i'm also not a fan of bad plots and action movies. I decided to check WandaVision anyway because i had read good things about it. The first three episodes were very promising and i really liked the mystery and somehow the sitcom parody setting felt original. I was looking forward to the fourth episode which was supposed to be where the genius plot is revealed. And revealed it was... I even suffered through the fifth episode. The series jumped right in the middle of ""Someone wants to take the enemy by force even though talking would be more effective BUT luckily we have the three out of thousand S. H. A. R. K or S. M. A. R. T or SOMETHING members who think differently and will (probably) save the world in the end"". I mean there's maybe a chance this changes into something good in the end but i'm not able to see it so this review is just for the first five episodes."
28 January 2021,Leave at your own peril!,10.0,"This series appears to start all safe, cosy, funny and familiar. But by episode three, it has slowly started to unfold to reveal a very dark, sinister undercurrent and plot - as all is not what it seems. So for those who left after episode one believing it to just be a remake of an early US comedy show you have been duped - along with Wanda & Vision! Clues are scattered in each episode, for you to slowly assemble as the plot gains momentum - enjoy the ride!"
19 February 2021,AMAZING!,8.0,
26 April 2022,Solid,8.0,Wandavision may not have lived up the many expectations and massive amount of hype that people were looking for but it's still a very solid show on its own.
17 March 2021,Negative reviews aren't relevant or valid.,10.0,This show is one of the most well put together shows I have ever seen. It does what movies in the mcu don't have the time to do. Old characters and concepts are brought back into play. Current characters grow with major character development. I think many people forget that this isn't a movie. It will have slow parts. Without these parts this series would not have had the build up that it did. Almost every other review I have read has given no actually arguments for why they did not like this series.
15 January 2021,Boring and dull,5.0,"Boring so far, not much plot development. Reminds you of I dream of genie but fails to impress"
19 January 2021,Casting stereotypes,,"Why..oh why in 2021 the husband is played by a guy who's 49, almost 50 and the wife is played by a woman who's 31, almost 32? Why can't it be the other way around? at least once, just once? Marvel, what a missed opportunity to some good for us all, not just for women..."
25 February 2021,LOVED IT,9.0,"I love the storyline, character intros, westview and everything about the show and have so many questions waiting to be answered by the next episode"
25 February 2021,"Good,, but toooo boring",7.0,"I liked both Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany's performances, but fir the first 7 episodes not ablot happened, as most of the episodes is just stretching for some un-important issues. The story Arc is too slow."
19 January 2021,I'm in the middle so far.,5.0,"First 2 episodes pretty dull and not really to impressed.

It's like a marvel knock off of bewitched and that ran for 8 years.

Suppose it can only get better....."
3 March 2021,One advice keep watching it.,9.0,It beginning you will be confused but u more u watch more u understand.
16 January 2021,Could I have been anymore bored,1.0,Im a huge fan of bewitched and other old sitcoms but this had none of the magic they had. All it did was bore me stupid until I ended up scrolling twitter as it was more interesting. I might just catch whatever the secret of whatever is happening on youtube and save myself the boredom. I'm a huge marvel fan but boy have they failed here
15 January 2021,What am i watching?,1.0,"Very boring, not funny. Why did they make this crap?"
25 January 2021,Dreadful,1.0,What a waste of time. Not sure why this got 7.5 cuttenly.
22 January 2021,Going too slow,7.0,It is really boring....i just wached the 5 last minutes of the first 3 episodes and was enough.
19 January 2021,SO FAR,1.0,"Not for 10, but also not the worst or most boring show ever. It was announced as the introductory part of the Phase 4, in my opinion this is actually the transitional part between Phase 3 and Phase 4. It is a little bit slower which is normal when it comes to mini series. This is just a setting for the appearance of x men and the continuation of the story of the scarlet witch. You shouldn't expect big action scenes like in MCEU movies or some hilarious jokes like in real sitcoms. Authors have already said what to expect, so don't make the same mistake as with the series Lost, when you didn't get what you imagined you should get. After two episodes 8.5, I hope it only gets better."
15 January 2021,Congratulations Keving Feige and others,10.0,Really good. Creative. Funny. Surprising. Let's what gonna happen at the next episodes. I just beg for doesn't have no sense service.
15 January 2021,I love Lucy or I Dream of Genie w/a dash of suspense,1.0,"I don't know where this is going. If I wanted to watch a show from the 60s , Id never turn this or that on. Slapstick stupid humor ... My neighbor is an alien kinda humor . Not for me ."
8 July 2021,Cliché of multiple shows,6.0,"Wandavision was such a cliché series. Mixing Merlin, heroes (season 1 is awesome), under the dome,once upon a time, some s.h.i.e.l.d. Stuff, .. and probably something i havent seen yet. Anyway. Nothing new 6/10. Not a bad watch overall. I suggest you watch the once I mentioned above if you like this."
15 January 2021,Exceptional.,9.0,WandaVision is undoubtedly pure meta. A transcending story nicely blended with early day tv show comedy is nothing but exciting and enthralling.
24 January 2021,Waited 6 months for this...... total joke,1.0,I was expecting the typical marvel action and got black and white 50's sitcom. Let's hope episode 3 gets the ball rolling
2 February 2021,A potentially great show ruined,4.0,This could have been a great show if they didn't pull that sitcom and black and white stuff.
15 January 2021,Rubbish,1.0,What a load of crap. I dont even want to give it 1 star
6 March 2021,Loved the show,10.0,
15 March 2021,So extremely difficult to stay awake,1.0,"Every episode I try to watch I fall asleep. We are at episode 6 now and I think I have seen about 10% of the show. But I think I didn't miss anything actually... So boring, nothing happening... (my wife makes me watch this)"
27 February 2021,Outstanding,10.0,Wanda had a broken heart. She made me cry in the last episode. I just love this series
2 February 2021,Very Bad experience.,1.0,Well I am was a big fan of marvel. But the first 3 episodes of this series was complete rubish and waste of time. I didn't expected this from marvel. With this series they spoil the great mighty name of AVENGERS...I am really sorry. I can't take this anymore..

18 February 2021,Keep watching,8.0,"First couple of episodes, especially episode one almost made me to give up on watching the series, however if you stick with it pass them it gets interesting and it's worth it!"
16 January 2021,Is this end of Marvel?,1.0,
3 February 2021,Moving up to a 2 rating!,2.0,"The first3 episodes I would give a -1000. The acting was something only Rodger Corman would be proud of. Which I wholly blame on the director and writers. The mess that was the first 3 episodes were the worst 3 episodes in the history of, well anything ever made. But episode 4 was actually quite good. Why run off 90% of your audience with the insulting garbage that was the first 3 episodes. I am one of the few people who could keep watching after the 3 worst episodes ever made. I just don't understand why you not only put the 3 worst episodes ever made to start your show. You insulted icon shows from the50's, 60's and 70's before you decided to put out a pretty good episode. The producers should have stepped in and told the director that the first 3 episodes were unacceptable. On a positive side this now has promise and maybe my perseverance will be rewarded."
27 February 2021,Best to show review,10.0,"Ignore every negative review before episode 4 It might have been an error on Disney's part to release only the first 2 episodes at once instead of 4 episodes. While I am on of the few people who absolutely loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes, this exceptional show has been getting a lot of hate due to a lack of plot.

... And then the 4th episode came out. Not only was it an exceptional episode, but it justified the use of the first three and even gave some answers to the many questions of Wanda vision.

Overall a brilliant show that shouldn't be judged on the first three episodes (especially if your only complaint is a lack of plot)"
19 February 2021,This is amazing!,10.0,
17 March 2021,Delightful,9.0,"What a good show, just a fun, heartfelt, marvel extravaganza."
26 February 2021,How is money thrown away?,1.0,
6 February 2021,Getting more stupid with each episode.,1.0,Started off ok then went downhill after third episode. More stupid than than you can imagine
15 January 2021,"Exceeding expectations as usual, Wandavision is the perfect breath of fresh air to spark a new beginning in the Marvel Universe!",10.0,"After a rare and rather dormant period for Marvel after a lack of content last year, Wandavision brings us back to two characters that have arguably had one of the most emotional arcs in the MCU to date.

The acting is superb, the sitcom style is bold and the creative choices are risky, but Marvel aren't holding back and are all about taking risks at this stage and Wandavision delivers on its promise of being a weird, intriguing, and simply stunning 50s style sitcom, all with a bit of Marvel magic sprinkled on top and with no spoilers here, let's just say that what they have in store for us going forward with the series is going to be truly brilliant!"
12 February 2021,One of the best Marvel series,10.0,Do yourself a favour and just watch it. Each episode is better than the last.
16 January 2021,for kids!!!,1.0,I am marvel fan and i waited too long for this but its for kids and childy
16 January 2021,Not enough good in the mix,,"This show is supposed to be a mix of classic sitcom and Marvel Cinematic Universe. Two episodes in, and it seems to be all sitcom and only a few seconds of ""what the F?""

I'm really not a fan of sitcoms, but even if I was, sitting through an entire episode for a few seconds of mystery seems kind of unsatisfying to me. Personally, I think Marvel didn't put enough chocolate in their peanut butter on this one."
7 March 2021,Great show,9.0,It was bit boring and confusing at first. Gradually it hooks us up and what more to say about the finale! It was terrific. But I had so much hope that they'll show or give a glimpse of Nightmare or Mefisto or even Dr strange. That's why 9 out of 10 for me.
26 February 2021,Absolutely love it,10.0,Absolutely love the show! The first view episodes i thought where is this going but very well done in the next episodes. I will bingewatch this serie a couple more times when all the episodes are public.
19 February 2021,"Persevere! After episode 3, you will be hooked",8.0,Excellent mini series of twists and turns. Found it very odd to start (but beautifully shot) but after a twist in episode 3 we were hooked .... and waiting to watch it each week on release date. Excellent nods to the Marvels movies throughout. Great watching.
16 January 2021,Stop Review bombing,10.0,"I loved the show and found the world building amazing, and the people who are giving it a one star and not having a good reason just to make the rating lower shame on you."
24 January 2021,"Asinine, inane drivel",1.0,"Three episodes into the series and it's an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back.

I keep reading about the ""dark turn"" that the series is going to take but I'm not going to be around long enough for the darkness.

It's not funny, scary, compelling, poignant, or any other emotion. It's just drivel. Inane drivel."
16 January 2021,I'm obsessed,10.0,I really don't know why the ratings are going down two episodes into the show. But I'm Hooked this show is weird but that's what makes it good.I think people need to remember that the show is supposed to be like nothing like marvel has done before.
12 March 2021,Just amazing,10.0,"For some people it can be confusing at the beginning, but in episode 4 everything starts to change. Please watch everything, you won't regret it!"
7 March 2021,"Watch it for Wanda, to feel love and fear of loneliness",10.0,"After avenger endgame, I thought there's nothing left in marvel studios. After watching Wandavision I'm very excited for future marvel projects. Character development for Wanda is insane... 10000/10"
16 March 2021,"""funny"" psychology for twelve-year teenagers...",3.0,"Not worth it for that time.... ""Comedy"" for children."
15 January 2021,Intriguing,10.0,"A bright world, with a sinister, almost horror undertone, this show plays effortlessly with the American zeitgeist around the TV eras it portrays. For modern audiences, shows like Leave It to Beaver are no longer as rosy as they were once supposed to be, because we cannot help watching them with awareness of the societal problems that lay beneath the mask of that era. WandaVision brings that happy mask vs realistic uncertainty conflict to head several times in its first episodes. A great example of art imitating life as Marvel steps into its next phase and its superheroes continue to portray and mirror the uncertainties of the real world within their fictional ones."
7 March 2021,"Exciting, artistic and unnerving!",10.0,"I LOVED this show. People are saying it gets better after the third episode, but those initial episodes are excellent and so important to the show's set up. Also, something we've never really seen from Marvel before! The acting is brilliant (it has been criticised for being campy/cheesy but that is the literal point) and really dynamic as the show shifts over the course of the season. I loved how experimental it was, whilst still embedding all of the elements you'd expect from a marvel movie. I also enjoyed the really unnerving, Truman-show like elements, it was genuinely creepy at points. I read someone said that this show had nothing to add to the marvel cinematic universe but, without spoiling anything, I don't think they actually watched the whole series. By the end, I was so moved. It explored grief in such a complex and sincere way."
16 January 2021,Give it a chance,9.0,People giving negative reviews don't understand the concept of the show at all.. But I do have one genuine complaint from the show.. they shouldn't have took the route of 1 releasing one episode per week.. it will be very difficult for the show to keep the audience hooked for 1.5 months
17 January 2021,BORING,1.0,Stupidest thing I have seen in a long time. Not worth the time.
15 January 2021,Abbott and Costello moment for the MCU,1.0,You've gotta be kidding me. A mashup of Bewitched and Lucy in B&W with 2 formally serious Avengers. I want to retch.
17 January 2021,Confused,3.0,Very disappointed that the show is only 22-24 minutes long with over 6 minutes of end credits. Seriously this show is an overrated joke.
24 June 2021,Entertaining,9.0,
29 March 2021,AMAZING JUST AMAZING,8.0,Me and my family watched it every time a new episode releases one of the best shows I have ever watched and the plot is fantastic I don't want to write spoilers. Watch it just watch it.
6 March 2021,Great Series!,8.0,"The first three episodes are kind of slow, but once you get to episode 4, a lot of stuff starts making sense. The show is cute, full of action, and a great Marvel series!"
18 January 2021,Wow,1.0,That was the worst episode of television I have ever seen
20 January 2021,I love it,9.0,"Just my take, something more then a braindead actionseries, I love the setting, the acting and the mystery, I think this will be awesome. If you expect standard action superheroes then settle your mind for something else."
25 March 2021,Satisfying,9.0,"In general, the new style in Marvel shows and good acting are the positive points."
16 January 2021,meh,2.0,From the trailer I guessed she was stuck in an illusion of some nefarious organization or a delusion or her own making. From the whole first two episodes I pretty sure I know which one it is. That's it. They haven't introduced any characters beyond their names. Its rather dull. They had fully developed characters they could've started of with a bang. but meh.
16 June 2022,Disney ruins,6.0,
15 January 2021,Amazing Shake up to the usual,10.0,"Okay so seen a lot of people giving this 1's because it doesn't follow the normal MCU model. As someone who was personally getting bored of watching the same type of films over and over again in the MCU this was super refreshing. I adore the creativity of the show and I cannot wait to see how it will ramp up the stakes in the coming weeks.

It's certainly not for everyone and you definitely need an open mind going in - if you come in expecting big explosions like the usual MCU films you're going to be sorely disappointed."
25 March 2021,Something different but great.,9.0,"If you go into WandaVision with an open mind, and you're at all a fan of The Twilight Zone, Black Mirror, or Electric Dreams, then you're really going to enjoy this side dish of a show to the MCU. My only complaint is episode length and count, which makes me believe you could supercut this into a film and it would make a great singular watch."
24 February 2021,WHAT A JOKE,1.0,"I made an account just to tell you guys, please skip episode 1 to 3, thats a total trash.. so they spent 75 million at that first 3 episodes for trash episode? Lol.."
16 January 2021,Too Early ?,10.0,
8 March 2021,Dragged out but in the end it delivers,7.0,"So I was kind of keen on watching this show because I am a fanboy of MCU movies, so it was quite interesting to see how they can deliver the same entertainment and story on tv.

The show delivers the typical Marvel story in which you have all the side jokes and characters that feel comic book like, with some variations between interesting, and straight out boring and fully predictable personalities. Nonetheless, the first few episodes deliver the old school sitcom vibe like experience, but the problem which I have noticed, is that it always leaves the most interesting and in my opinion exciting parts at the end of each episode, which feels like as if I was watching commercials, just to see 5 minutes of what I came to watch for material.

I understand that the whole show is based on the sitcoms, but it felt really dragged out later on, because it literally felt as if you were watching a sitcom, I mean, I get it for the first 2 episodes I guess, it does make you feel the atmosphere and stuff like that. However, on later episodes, it just feels quite boring and unnecessary to leave it on the same formula.

The characters of Wanda and Vision are pretty stretched out, from the previous movies and installments, so the actors were the starlight and the coolest part of this show.

However, I didn't quite liked the Monica Rambeau character, and the gang (Jimmy,Darcy), they felt quite cartoonish, and not as funny as the show wanted them to be. I get it that this is a comic book based show, and I'm all up for it, but MCU is famous for it's innovation of fantasy and creativity, I mean they managed to have a talking raccoon and a unicorn flying chick in the movies and it was freaking awesome.

But the characters in this show felt that they didn't had proper motivation for their tasks other than that it is their job to do so.

Thank god the last 2 episodes finally broke out of the mundane sitcom style and delivered MCU worthy material which I liked.

Oh yeah, the main bad guy, gotta say, she was a bit cringe, I do understand how it all went down, but I guess she wasn't supposed to be on the spotlight in this show, so she did her job and it was ok.

If you a fan of MCU, chances are, you are gonna like it just as I did in the end."
12 March 2021,I'm so disappointed,4.0,
3 January 2022,I really tried to like it...,1.0,"... but dafuqdidijustwatch.jpg

How boring can we make it? Yes! It's not funny or original in my opinion, it's just annoying. Maybe it gets better later, but I already wasted 3 episodes of my life now."
19 February 2021,Garbage,1.0,Disturbingly cringe. It is disgusting and just nothing but filth.
13 March 2021,A show about Karen,5.0,"WandaVision is a show about a Karen, who throws a tantrum because she is single and unhappy with life. And if she doesn't get what she wants she gets triggered and cancel everyone"
28 April 2021,Classic,9.0,"Has that classic, sitcom feel to it with a solid storyline. Worth watching! Loved it."
11 May 2021,It is a gem,9.0,"WandaVision is a great show. The actors did a phenomenal job and you could see the hard work that was put on the show. It was a great way to spend your time and the weekly release dates expanded the show a lot more. Good one MCU! However, the whole Bohner thing was pretty meh and Episode 8 was not that great.

Do I recommend it? Yes!"
15 January 2021,Must watch series,10.0,"Awesome series of marvel but not like other it's different oneI almost quit watching about halfway through the first episode. It seemed kind of silly and over the top. However, this all changes when the show starts to take on dark and perhaps sinister undertones. I think this series will be a mystery that slowly starts to unravel with each episode."
29 January 2021,Great show confusing,9.0,But great Many Questions very few answers The town almost reminds me of stepford wives
16 January 2021,Terrible,1.0,"Unappealing, i love lucy wunnabe. Just bad. Terrible"
26 February 2021,Unbelievable awesome,10.0,"I love every episode, this show is the best I ever see"
3 February 2021,Sorry I tried,2.0,I tried to get past episode 2 but it's shocking. Pointless
24 August 2021,Brilliant Show,10.0,This is by far the very best of the Marvel Disney plus shows out right now!
17 January 2021,It's just perfect,10.0,"First of all when I saw the first two chapters I understood what Marvel wanted to do, I personally liked the series a lot, and I liked how they adapted the type of comedy from the 50s and 60s and I'm dying to see the chapter of The 70s for me the series I think is going a good way, people criticize the comedy and the truth is I don't know what they expected because that is the comedy of those decades and I really like how the series progresses, in my opinion simply You cannot judge a series by its first two chapters, and believe me it is not the only series that has a bad start"
16 January 2021,"To the ""Karens"" that are watching this show...",10.0,"I Don't know what peope expect from the first few episodes. We have all seen the trailers (that is not one trailer but at least 15+) and it was expected what to see in the first few episodes. Stop messing the whole rating of the TV show. You are ruining it with your ""Karen"" way of explaining why the show sucks."
8 March 2021,It only gets better.,8.0,Starts weakly but grows on you and gets better and better. Nice job
7 March 2021,Hilariously Bad,1.0,"Marvel super fan, but honestly this was a disgrace to the MCU. Ranking this anything above a 1 is a disservice to the fans. Hate to see it. Really hope they pick it up soon."
1 February 2021,Keep watching.. it gets better,8.0,"The first two episodes are funny, a little dull with a couple of interesting scenes. The 3rd one picks up speed and the 4th one will keep you wanting more!!! Keep watching! I promise you won't regret it!!"
16 January 2021,10/10 is overdoing it but it's still worth a watch.,7.0,"Marvels hardcore fans always give 10/10 to the great majority of movies and series but giving this a 10 which implies it's absolutely perfect in every way with absolutely nothing to complain about is overrating it greatly. Don't get me wrong, it's definetly worth a watch but don't get your hopes up too much thinking it will be the best series you've ever watched from all these 10/10 reviews."
6 March 2021,Solid series...let down by an underwhelming end,7.0,
3 March 2021,What a big disappointing of marvel project,3.0,"We been waiting for more 16 months After watching spider man far from home in the big screen, was so magical marvel one, but wandavision was different project for Kevin feige because he wanted bring Sitcom style for phase 4, but doesn't worked for me as marvel fan, It just not increased to next marvel Level, not at least like infinity war tone"
30 January 2021,Episode 4...,10.0,"I knew something was coming. I do wish, as others have said, we got this episode earlier, but as a marketing person, I get the approach. Episode 4 was like hitting the first peak of a rollercoaster. My son and I have spent the last 1/2 hour talking through this episode, those episodes before and the whole MCU. Bravo. It is hard to wait for next week. This is great."
15 April 2023,Loved it,10.0,"WandaVision is a remarkable and innovative show that completely shattered my expectations. This Marvel series takes viewers on a wild and exciting ride through multiple decades of classic sitcoms while still maintaining its superhero roots.

The show stars Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany who give some of the best performances of their careers. Olsen, in particular, showcases a range of emotions and proves she is more than capable of carrying her own series. Bettany also shines, bringing a depth and humor to Vision that we haven't seen before.

But what really sets WandaVision apart is its unique storytelling style. Each episode takes on a different era of sitcoms and uses them to explore Wanda's psyche and the mysteries surrounding her. The attention to detail in the sets, costumes, and music is also incredible and makes for an immersive viewing experience.

Additionally, the show introduces new characters that are sure to have a significant impact on the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The way the show connects to the broader MCU is masterfully done and will leave fans wanting more.

Overall, WandaVision is a fantastic addition to the Marvel franchise and a must-watch for anyone who enjoys superhero stories, sitcoms, or just great television."
15 January 2021,Seriously.,1.0,Wanda wishes she had a vision. I won't be watching any more of these. Couldn't make it through the first episode. So sad. Great characters.
23 January 2021,Absolute trash,2.0,I just finished the first three episodes. How disappointing! I was really hoping for something that was actually good. So boring! Waste of time.
6 February 2021,IT'S AMAZING!!!!!!!!!,10.0,"It gets better and better as time goes by! I'm the beginning it might get a little boring, but after episode 4 you're gonna be hanging at the edge of your seat!"
15 January 2021,Kids will hate it,10.0,Bats**t crazy with Easter eggs galore with so many nods and winks - this isn't superhero tv this is art.
7 February 2021,Thanks Marvel,10.0,
22 January 2021,1st Episode,1.0,"Just bad.. very very bad tv.. few good little things but in general its very very bad (no ""art excuse"" its just bad tv)"
17 January 2021,Pretty bad!,5.0,
5 March 2021,A great emotional journey I didn't know I needed,9.0,"Not gonna lie, I was not looking forward to this. I anticipated ""Loki"" and ""Falcon and The Winter Soldier"" much more. I kept thinking ""Why do a show about Wanda and Vision, when Vision is already dead??"". I didn't get the appeal and the whole sitcom setting just seemed weird. I'm so glad I was wrong.

Wandavision is a great dive into these characters that have mostly been sidelined in the MCU until now and that I now love because of this. The main theme of this show is dealing with grief, loneliness and loss. The sitcom setting ended up being a lot of fun, because we got to see these characters in different decades and styles of sitcoms all while dealing with the themes I've mentioned. I want to keep this has much spoiler free as I can, so I won't go much deeper, because this really is a great ride, especially if you're a fan of the MCU, but the weekly discussion and theories that fans came up with (most we see now were really silly) were really fun to experience and I'm really glad I was part of that ride! This is a show that I will rewatch, just to see the little clues sprinkled in the earlier episodes and perhaps catch some things I didn't in the first watch.

This was emotional, heartbreaking, funny, game changing, it set the tone for the MCU going forward and I can't wait to see what they do with it!

Also, shoutout to Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and Kathryn Hann, you guys are amazing!"
16 January 2021,"This is NOT Marvel, this is MARKET.",1.0,"Just to show a 15-minute tricks which will only support future movies, they made a complete series of 9 episodes. As they had nothing to show, they set it in 60-90s era just to fool the audience with some overused jokes of that time. This is a classic example of lazy writing. After watching first two episodes, I completely understand that all these upcoming shows are only to support the upcoming movies which make billions and millions."
29 March 2021,Ohhhh....,7.0,
30 December 2023,What is that?,1.0,"This is unwatchable. Nothing more to say about it. This show feels like a chore to watch. This show have everything I hate and nothing I like. How can this boring show got that popular? Everytime someone is talking I want to punch them in the face. Everyone are anoying, everything they do is dumb and so bland... All ""joke"" are bad. Is this a parody? Even as a parody it's bad. I hope I will be able to forget everything I saw and heard about WandaVision. Honestly, I think I got PTSD watching this, I'm not even joking. It gave me so much anxiety. There's no doubt that the ratings and reviews about WandaVision are fake and paid.

Don't watch this!!!"
15 January 2021,excellent start for marvel.,10.0,"Excellent start for marvel. wandavision is something new for the superhero genre, the series promises exactly what we saw in the trailer, therefore we can say that over time the series will grow much more. In conclusion, trusting that he will follow her on the right track, I give her 10 stars, but if in the end they do not remain constant, I have no problem lowering her grade."
2 February 2021,PLAYER!!,10.0,Don't judge the book by its cover and this series by first 2 episodes
17 July 2022,First and Only Masterpiece Marvel ever Created,10.0,"It will b a short one, never ever reviewed here after hundreds of masterpieces seen as movies n seasons, so first ever review,, i mean just give oscar to Elizabeth Olsen.. she deserve in every way.."
28 February 2021,After 7 episodes... still trying,3.0,Review may change but I really don't get this series. Episodes are tedious (despite most actors doing a good job); I don't get the fuss over the series or logic behind some of the key plot points. Thankfully only two more episodes to go through to see if my view of series will improve.
27 January 2021,Loved it,10.0,"Loved the first three, a lot of people are not able to understand it, the show will answer our questions in the future episodes we have to be patient about it it's a sitcom not a movie"
2 June 2023,Weird and entertaining; a good start to Phase 4,7.0,
5 March 2021,Reality often disappointing 💔🙂,7.0,After having too much rumours and Expectations Marvel just ruin everything! At least it had a cameo of Dr.strange or Loki! Wtf!
15 January 2021,Intriguing start to what should be an interesting show,9.0,
16 January 2021,Fresh and funny,9.0,Very old school yet very fresh and funny. Classic stuff from the 60ties done for XXI century.
15 January 2021,One of the most intelligent and original piece of super hero content,10.0,What a start .. super original and intelligent . This is where marvel breaks its own template and creates a new one . Non linear and shows how it's done ... I can bet episodes 3-10 will take this to 100 notches up and connects the MCU to the expanded universe !!
29 August 2021,Confusing with plot holes,4.0,This show was lacking greatly. Too much goofiness riddled throughout the whole series with huge plot holes that made no sense at all. Like where did the villain in the show even come from. The show was fragmented and a real disappointment.
1 March 2021,Just doesn't do much for me,2.0,"Slow start to the show, waste of multiple episodes before any plot even occurs. 6 episodes in and still don't feel any reasons to watch another episode. Others may hate me for this but The Boys and Doom Patrol are much more entertaining ""super hero"" series than anything I have seen from Marvel."
15 January 2021,wooden acting,3.0,"Stiff-wooden acting, seems very forced story line. Didn't enjoy the first episode."
15 January 2021,I can't believe how good this show turns out to be,10.0,This is without a doubt the best TV show I have watched in my whole life. Truly incredible! I cannot wait to See what the MCU has in store for us in the coming years.
15 January 2021,Got potential,6.0,"It's an artistic sit com but the first two episodes were somewhat lacking. The 'comedy' aspect is period correct and as a result a little bit corny but looking past that, it has the potential to be a great show. Olsen and Bettany both put in a good performance so far."
15 January 2021,do not trust the bad reviews!,10.0,"I was so exited to watch the series but then after seeing some reviews here i thought the first episodes could be boring and the series may not be what i expected. I WAS WRONG! The first two episodes are amazing and it's actually funny. There are also some creepy and intriguing scenes, they really know how to keep the mystery and the suspense. There are a lot of references to other Marvel movies and the chemistry between Wanda and Vision is perfect. They also already introduced new characters that I really wanna know more about. It's completely different from everything else in the MCU and it's a great way to introduce fase 4! Can't wait for the next episodes and still don't know what to expect!

the high score is for episode 1 and episode 2. when the other ones come out i may change it, who knows. (but i don't think i will)."
13 August 2021,Great and very emotional show,8.0,
17 March 2021,Super Boring Finale,7.0,Do not create hype if you can not live up to it. Super boring finale. There were episodes that i can watch a dozen times but finale wasted all that effort
15 January 2021,Scarlet Witch is the best,10.0,"This show introduced a new concept to the ""superhero genre"""
8 July 2021,She just wanted a home,10.0,
11 April 2021,"8,1rate ?",3.0,How did this get 8 in rating. Not even over avarage 5.
18 January 2021,What's the point of this?,6.0,"Two of the most powerful avengers inside this, omg, and they say ww84 is bad. Let's see what's next"
15 January 2021,Terrible so far,7.0,This series attempts to recreate a classic family sitcom and drastically fails. Even by the standards back then this show would be wildly unsuccessful and never make it past one season. They better up their game and make the show less boring and of what has already been done. We don't need exact recreations of a classic sitcom find something new to put into it. There's a reason that style of sitcom went out of style. Overall such a disappointment
27 May 2021,Superheroes in a 60s slapstick comedy tv series??,2.0,"Ive heard it gets better, but I honestly couldn't get thru the 1st two episodes. The so-called comedy was flat, and anything resembling a plot has yet to develop.

Wasted an hr of my time. Perhaps if I have time to utterly waste I'll get further along.

This doesn't resemble Marvel in any way shape or form. Huge disappointment."
6 April 2021,Really enjoyed it,9.0,"It's really great l, can't wait the second season!"
28 February 2021,Marvel storytelling brought to television,8.0,"There is a lot of promise here, we get expanded backstory for the Scarlett witch and vision. Two characters who had till now only been on the periphery of the marvel films and which are now given much greater weight thanks to the performances of Olsen and Bettany.

The show opens with Witch and Vision living a form of the idealised domestic life we have seen characterised is such shows as 'I love Lucy'. Temporal shifts every week change this setting while uncovering clues why she has sought refuge in this world. Excitingly, the show starts to tease deeper revelations including the possibility of a Multiverse and the reintroduction of familiar parts played by different actors.

Marvel will, hopefully, use the rich characterisation brought through televised storytelling and transfer that onto the big screen for an even richer and more satisfying pay off. Thus far the serialised format has been used to its advantage, with well judged cliffhanger endings and a deep emotional core, notably in its meditation on grief. With a willingness to experiment and show flawed characters in unconventional settings marvel shows that the type of stories it does tell never has to be rigidly defined by the modern blockbuster."
5 February 2021,The entire season feels like one long filler Episode,4.0,This Plot so far (Episode 1-5) could easily be a single filler episode in any other Series. I honestly don't see the appeal.
17 January 2021,Well that was terrible,1.0,"I've watched everything Marvel and even DC that they produce good bad or otherwise. I even made it through Green Lantern.

I really tried to give this a chance, but I had to stop it halfway through episode 2. Its dumb, irrelevant, and leaves nothing to hold onto that it will get any better. Skip this and jump back into the MCU with the next title."
28 January 2021,MOST UNIQUE MCU as of now,10.0,
16 January 2021,This is tooooooo bad,1.0,Not what I expected I wish marvel can make series like dc
16 January 2021,Instant gratification?,9.0,"I've never seen a series of reviews with such babies seeking instant gratification. Waaa waaa waaa! I want it right now! Me me! Just wait, small ones. This series is going to some surreal and scary places and you will be happy. Quit jumping around in the back seat and put on your seat belts. It's a bit of a drive to the amusement park but we will get there. And I promise there will be fun rides and ice cream. And maybe some monsters."
28 March 2021,Great😭,10.0,Great.... waiting for 2nd season.. please marvel give us 2nd season.
17 January 2021,Looks very promising,10.0,"Looks promising! It's the start of something totally new with maybe the multiverse, etc. This show is the 1st that open the way to a totally new saga. At the very 1st episode we know something is wrong, even more at the second episode. Can't wait for every next friday!"
5 March 2021,"It was GREAT but, there's a ""but""",8.0,It was great. The series started slow-paced and will eventually go wild and super hyped in the later half of the series. The final episode though did not end that great. It was too weak for me. It was like eating a dry and tasteless dessert after a great dinner. But overall it was great.
15 October 2023,Horrendously Bad,1.0,
20 January 2021,Disappointment,3.0,I am watching the episode 2 at the moment...just can't understand why need to set in this world and style of this two important heros of marvel....two episodes like this are too much.....
5 March 2021,Awesome,10.0,Just finish the show Uniqueness is at it's best Not the ending we want but the ending we deserve
26 July 2021,Most powerful women heartbroken.,4.0,
15 January 2021,incredible,10.0,"Funny,mysterious and good casting its nothing seen in the marvel universe before. I hope the next mcu series are as good as this"
26 February 2021,A new start to the Marvel TV shows,9.0,"While watching this show, i was overwhelmed by the great writing present in this show. The constant twists and references to comics makes you attached to the screen for the whole episode, and when it ends, you just wonder why the hell do we have to wait a week for the next episode. So far, i am loving this show and i hope the others yet to come shows lead into more of these fantastic stories behind our favourite heroes and villains. I truly recomend you to watch it."
17 January 2021,I decided to stop procrastinating and go to finish writing my thesis instead of watching this garbage,1.0,"There isn't really a lot to tell. When I saw this show available I got excited and instead of working on my thesis and procrastinating I decided to give it a go. I watched half of the first episode, then I started skipping forward. I spent about 15 minutes on first 2 episodes in total and then I decided that I would much rather do some work (or do literally anything else) than watch this cringe... whatever this is. I have never in my life been so put off by any other TV show so fast. I don't even care if it gets better in next episodes. The next episodes could be the best episodes ever made in any TV show but I will not be watching them. This show is dead to me."
15 January 2021,What is this show trying to be?,,Not my cup of tea. All black and white pretending to be a 50's comedy. Including the bad humor. Who knows maybe it will make a come back and we find out what it's all about. But to spend so many episodes on it is a really really hard watch.
30 March 2021,Definitly Love it,9.0,TV show concept blow my mind.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
29 January 2021,Mind bending & reality warping wanda,10.0,What a wonderful out of the box thing trying by Marvel studios. I will give it 11 out of 10 reviews. Complete masterpiece
1 February 2022,I think...,7.0,"The first 2 episodes in the series are in the style of 80's comedy series, but there are necessary scenes for the next episodes. I liked the show except for some unnecessary scenes. Marvel knows this business well.."
20 March 2021,Very boring,1.0,"Only watched it because it's connected to the MCU. Just watch some Youtube overviews on this to get caught up with the storyline for future MCU titles, don't waste time on this like I did."
15 January 2021,"Subtle, original, intriguing",10.0,"Tipping its hat to legendary 50s and 60s sitcoms I found the setups, plot and pacing great. Very subtle as to where it's going which I liked. Intriguing concept, and an original fusion of ideas. Full marks after first 2 episodes 👍"
16 February 2021,WORST SHOW EVER.,1.0,"Horrible pacing, it's almost half way done, and we still haven't gotten anything interesting. Characters are annoying, and just an overall bad show. Just watch it for the MCU, like me."
4 March 2021,Worst superhero series,4.0,This make me worst feel when I saw Wandavision . Character development is very poor. Storyline and direction is savage . VFX is completely insane . There is nothing to watch in this series . I dont know what are actors doing in series . If you want to save time than dont watch Wandavision
6 July 2021,Absolutely brilliant,10.0,"An absolute must watch for any Marvel fan out there. Don't be put off by the first 3 episodes, it will all make sense and come together after then. Loved all the Easter eggs they put in there. Top tip, the last 3 episodes have an added extra after the credits."
12 March 2021,What a Big let down this entire show is !!,4.0,
22 January 2021,I think it's great,8.0,
7 May 2021,Worth it,8.0,"I'll start out by saying I think the entire Marvel Universe is heavily overrated. I haven't found any of the films to be particularly brilliant. Also I appreciate Disney and what they do is great, but it's still not my thing. WandaVision was different.

This really was a great show - and there are only a handful of shows that are great during season 1. I would definitely recommend watching it no matter who you are, as the responses to it don't seem to follow any kind of pattern... just give it a shot. But give it a shot with the FULL INTENTION of finishing five episodes, as the first two or three will leave you unsure... but the first couple actually get better as the storyline evolves in the mid-season episodes."
15 January 2021,Does not bore you even an ounce!! Perfectly directed.,7.0,"So far the series looks well. A smooth cut to the chase without rushing it!! The second episode really gripped me. And to be honest time just flew by watching the episodes, and for me that's a great compliment. Really worth watching. It is very entertaining, not boring at all. It's funny to the right amount and keeps the suspense of the story intact which makes the first two episodes perfectly directed and written."
20 March 2021,Absolute mess,5.0,"I cannot fathom all the good reviews for this series. Sure the production and acting is great; that's where it ends.

It starts out as a comedy, then turns into a Superhero geek fest and then ends as pointlessly as it began."
13 February 2021,It's amazing but......,9.0,"Look what we have here it's first series in marvel universe the picture is so wonderful and graphics are amazing and story it's so interesting But there is one remark that you feel that this series is a long movie, but divided into episodes, and this is not a defect, but I think it is natural as a first experience in the world of series for Marvel universe"
12 March 2021,Bru,2.0,"Okay the first two episodes are slower than my elderly grandparents. Yes you can keep watching and it should get better but the whole point of watching something isn't to sit through it and hope it gets better, its to enjoy every part of it. So yeah making us go through the first couple of episodes is horrible and a waste of time. Sad to see it as the actors are amazing in it and you can clearly see the time and work out in, however the beginning episodes just ruin it. E.g you go out for a meal and you're super pumped because you hear it's amazing but then for starters you just get a bowl of warm water instead of soup. Even though you get an amazing stake for you're main course the beginning meal still makes you sad and disappointed."
5 April 2021,13 years,1.0,"Greetings from Serbia, a country that has existed for 13 years, as you say Elizabeth Olsen."
26 March 2021,Not The Worse Entry In the MCU...,5.0,"Started off strong, but nothing set up has any meaningful pay off. In the end it's just a bloated Marvel movie."
1 April 2021,Marvel Fan,10.0,"At first I was very worries about how it will turn out .. At the end I loved every bit of it.

And I loved how it carried out from the MCU movies into the series.

I admire Elizabeth Olsen even more now .. the cast is funny having Kathryn is just joy on top of joy she's outstanding and Definitly can't wait for season 2 and will there be some crossovers from different Marvel characters ? I really hope so."
11 March 2021,loved it!,10.0,"Man! where do I start, at the beginning I was like, what am I watching.. the old-school sitcom episodes were fun but as soon as episode 3 to 4 came it shifted. I was like DAMN marvel studios you did IT! loved the acting too, its a must watch for the comic lovers its a great watch!"
15 January 2021,"WOW! All of these bad reviews, have you even read the comics?",10.0,"This show is getting so many bad reviews, and I don't understand! Have you read the comics? Do you know anything about Scarlet Witch? WandaVision is so good, and if you are a fan of House of M then you will LOVE it! I love seeing Wanda Maximoff as she is, and Elizabeth Olsen does such an amazing job portraying her. We are only 2 shows in and so far it has exceeded all of my expectations!"
13 March 2021,Very bad,1.0,Very disappointed...boring. . . Nothing has happened.
15 January 2021,Obviously great.......,10.0,Elizabeth Olsen is my favourite marvel female character. So obviously I will give positive review and I loved it.......
19 January 2021,An experiment,10.0,I like it. It's interesting and I look forward to see how this new experiment unfolds.
23 February 2021,Made me wish I didn't own a TV,1.0,"This series is utterly tragic. It is cheesy low grade TV with a story line as bad as the acting, which is saying something.

It starts off pretty bad, and then somehow manages to get progressively worse with each episode, in fact the decline is visible with each passing minute, it is that bad.

The storyline is utterly lamentable, I simply cannot understand how any could even possibly think this is good TV.

I felt compelled to watch it, because I thought ""Seriously, this has to get better sometime soon"" and of course it never does.

It is unsophisticated and low grade cheap TV, and therein lies its possible appeal for the seemingly endless myriad of good reviews.

If you want to watch something which will quite literally rot your brain then this could be for you.

If you are a more discerning intellectual viewer, I challenge you to get past the first few episodes without giving way to the urge to literally burn your TV set to the ground."
5 February 2021,Don't be a blind fan of Marvel !!!,1.0,This show is probably one of worst shows that I've watched. The funny part is that there is no funny part and jokes are so lame. Atleast add a pinch of entertainment instead of just laughing sounds in background that would made it much better. They just wanted a 90min of movie to be stretched into an whole show. I don't understand how people are finding it entertaining. Looking at the reviews makes me question the reality if the reviews are real or are paid ones.
27 April 2021,Love it!,10.0,"Loved this show! It had a great mix of superhero's, old family sitcoms, and mystery."
16 January 2021,Worst thing I've ever had to watch,1.0,"Let me first just say that no I didn't read the comics or anything, I'm strictly a fan of super hero movies. I just couldn't do it so it's hard to really give it a review. I've sat through a lot of terrible movies and shows but I can honestly say this one I couldn't. GF and I started watching it together and quickly got turned off by it. Skimmed forward to see if it got any better, it didn't. Super cringy and hard to watch some of your favorite characters in the movies get turned into this. Skimmed the second episode as well and it was the same. Very disappointed as there has been such a lack of Marvel for so long now and I was really excited for this (although skeptical by the trailers). I hear after the first two episodes it gets good so since there is nothing else going on I'll probably check them out. Hopefully it's more along the lines of the rest of the Marvel movies."
19 February 2021,Review after episode 4,4.0,"This is a review after episode 4. Because everybody said: 'Wait till episode 4. It's genius.' Well, for me at least, it's not. Yeah it's a cool twist but it was not totally out of the blue and unforseen. I believe this will be a very good show. But the suffering through episodes 1 (especially) to 3 still rings in the back of my head. Only with the confidence of oh so fanatic fans you can stretch this kind of build up over three episodes. With 7 minute outros each! I thought this was too much. And episode 1 is absolutely and completely useless (so far). I will continue watching and I am happy I made it through these first 3 episodes. But there were so many times I was annoyed and wanted to skip ahead."
22 January 2021,"Started off very poorly, but now I'm a bit freaked out.",8.0,"I was going to sign up and give this show a 1/10 review last week after watching those first 2 abysmal episodes.

Something that could have been done in 5 minutes was stretched out for way too long... I was going to stop watching but figured I'd give it one last chance.

Then the third episode was rubbish as well......... until the last 5 minutes. Then let me say, I started to get a little bit freaked out. The ""awakening"" that begins to happen in that last 5 minutes is a little bit freaky... mainly because it feels as though this TV show is not designed as entertainment, but rather target at us, the viewers, because WE are asleep and unaware of the reality we are in. The little nuances they are noticing are like the little nuances we should be noticing in our everyday lives.

What is reality? What am I doing here? Why am I hear? These are the questions Wanda & Vision is beginning to realise. Should we begin to realise them too within our own reality?"
1 February 2021,Could Have Avoided A LOT Of Hate Mail,8.0,"TPTB could have avoided a LOT of hate mail if they had interspersed Ep 4 with Ep's 1, 2 and 3...."
9 February 2021,Read this,10.0,Everyone saying it's just a sitcom.... don't listen to them look all the episodes and you will all understand.
9 March 2021,Super awesome,9.0,But I missed dr.strange in this series so I gave 9 rating
15 December 2021,Overatted show,3.0,Frankly speaking this was something bwas not expected from MCU. All though the performance by Olsen and Paul was excellent.. but the overall show is a disaster.
9 March 2021,Marvel never fails to deliver!,10.0,I loved the first 2 episodes I don't quite get the hate around those episodes. The whole series was AMAZING.
13 January 2022,First two episodes are a turnoff,5.0,The Disney plus Marvel shows have been great. In my opinion tv shows blow away any movie . Just think about I'd your favorite movie wad 24 hours long . Only downside to these new shows is the 6 show seasons wish they did more atleast 20 episodes seems like shows keep getting shorter and shorter seasons . It used to be a show would go for 16 to 24 episodes a season now 6? But Wanda vision was the last marvel show I tried to watch and I mean tried multiple times but never could get through the first 2 episodes. They are beyond corny to the point it hurt to watch. I hear it gets better around episode 4 I may just start from there and see how that goes but Disney hurt themselves by starting the show the way they did I can't understand how they figured casual watcher of avengers movies puts on Wanda vision and how Disney imagined that viewer being intrigues with how the show starts.
16 January 2021,Beat my expectations so far,9.0,"The review bombing in here is hysterical. If you watched this show while not paying attention, sure maybe you missed everything that was going on. I'm so floored that Marvel had the guts to do something so different and interesting and STILL have the quality that we expect from the MCU. I've never been so ready to see what comes next. This is amazing so far, just don't expect another run of the mill beat-em-up superhero serial"
5 March 2021,Starts strong ends slow,6.0,Basically nothing much after episode 8 big disapointment
21 January 2022,Boring,4.0,"I don't understand how Marvel started to create so stupid movies!

They are probably out of ideas, but desperate for money!

Don't bother to watch all of the episodes!

Watch just 7, 8 and 9.

The movie starts from episode 7."
13 February 2021,Masterpiece,10.0,This marvel TV show is so ridiculously fun and exciting to watch. Each episode get better and better. The only thing I would say is I wish the episodes would be longer. Other than that it's just thrilling. 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
20 July 2021,Super Hero Fan Trying To Holding The Ratings,1.0,An Overrated Show.....Loki Was Far Better Than This....
7 April 2021,Absolutely Epic,10.0,Loved this series from ep1 to ep9 i can't wait for season 2 if there is one coming.
15 January 2021,Marvelous!!!,10.0,"Being a Marvel fan, I had high expectations and I'm telling you this, these two episodes were just fantastic. Very well direction and narration. Go for it, no doubts."
15 January 2021,I need more episodes!,10.0,"This show is a mix of everything amazing, and it's already blowing my mind. ignore any bad reviews, the beginning is meant to be old fashioned. honestly this show made me love wanda even more and i didn't even think that was possible!"
28 November 2021,Why is this getting good reviews?,2.0,"I suffered through 3 episodes and can't do it anymore. I gave it 2 stars for the quality of the product but it is the most boring thing I've suffered through in a long time. Please, someone explain to me why this is worth watching??"
22 January 2021,Disney took the easy road yet again.,3.0,
5 March 2021,Beautiful character study for Wanda,9.0,Captivating from start to finish. Minus that one cringe joke.
27 February 2021,Ta gud (is god),10.0,"Is god, I love it, Thanks For Read Roar Roar (again) :)"
9 July 2021,An boring movie spread across 9 Episodes...,3.0,"I love most marvel movies and series, but this one was horrible. All the comedy episodes are super boring and the plot takes forever to Pick up some speed. The worst marvel series I have seen so far."
8 February 2021,"its combines truman show, annihilation, and twilight zone",4.0,
15 January 2021,I already watched Lucy and Ricky /Dick Van Dyke show,7.0,Not a fan maybe In Mid season or near end it will be ok to watch it's not for me . I don't think it's gonna work but I been wrong before many times.I litterally hit FF through it hoping for something other then what I grew up with ill watch it only for Easter eggs of the future MCU
11 March 2021,Best series of marvel,10.0,Dont go by the first three episodes though they might be boring but the last 6 episodes would definitely made it up
12 March 2021,I just wish it was better...,4.0,"Because its Marvel, i gave it a chance to impress me... i would never normally watch a sitcom style show. because it part of the Marvel CU i held it to a higher standard than normal TV show/films.

disapointing on all fronts... its just slow and the pay offs are sub par. the fake press before hand teasing amazing cameos was cheap! - just give me spider man swinging in to punch someone.

i dont care if some of the pay offs for this season are in the next films.. it still makes this a boring season.

Kat Dennings was cool."
15 January 2021,MARVEL NAILED IT AGAIN!,10.0,"Wandavision is, indeed, the most unique project that Marvel Studios has ever done. As long as i can see, the show is so much fun but yet so mysterious, weird and original. It is worth watching!"
1 August 2021,Great from begining to end,9.0,"This is a story of grief and self knowledge. Don't know why people didn't like the end, I think it was tight and neat, final battle and everything. I would agree that the beginning is somewhat slow but it sets the mood and later helps us understand the psychological moment of the main character. I really really enjoyed it and it think it works perfectly as a series instead of a movie as it allows an in crescendo pace without sacrificing rythm."
15 March 2021,Couldn't handle it,1.0,"At the beginning I was quite impressed by this classic black and white american tv show and I was expecting that this will continue for a few minutes, but unfortunately I was forced to continue watching this thing after the ""haha"" moment was completely gone. Then I started with episode 2 and guess what more of the same. Then I had to ask a friend ""for how long should I wait till the classic thingy ends"" and his answer made me stop the series."
17 January 2021,Reviews and ratings here are a joke.,,"At the moment 38% of people who rated this series have rated it at a 10, what a joke. Why is it that a lot of Marvel fans rate everything a 10 before it is even finished or better yet aired. Right now the series is pretty much an oldies sitcom with some dark undertones, but after the first two episodes I'm intrigued where the series is going. It will definitely pick up in the next episode, though lot of people are pretty clueless and think the whole series will be done in a sitcom style. Yikes. If you have Disney+ definitely watch this, but maybe wait for more episodes so things really get rolling. I will update my rating for this when the series is finished but for now it's a solid 7."
2 April 2021,Starts off I Dream of Jeannie ends up Superman III,5.0,I'm sure there's a clever idea in here but it's trying too hard at being something different but in the end just fails.
6 March 2021,Watch worth,8.0,You can enjoy the show and you will miss all marval action
15 January 2021,Oddly Satisfying,9.0,
16 January 2021,Amazing,10.0,"Looking amazing,humour and mystry is both in threre. i loved the both episodes"
6 March 2021,Wandaful!,8.0,
15 January 2021,Get on with it!,,"The story line is way to drawn out. I mean come on these people are Marvel superheroes. I get trying to capture a larger audience, but don't forget about the fans that have always been here. We expect a little faster tempo."
19 January 2021,Original and Well done,10.0,"Compare this to any show on today and you just can't. Emphasis on ANY SHOW ON TODAY. This is such a fantastic homage to old television from the 50s-60s (so far in the first two episodes) that if you can appreciate those shows, then you can appreciate how well done they did this but with perfectly adding suspense and cliffhangers either half way through or the end to keep you so intrigued. Also, it's worth mentioning that the acting is so fantastic. Anyone who thinks it's over the top clearly doesn't understand that's the point of ""old style acting."" Worth every second of my time and then some."
15 January 2021,Brings me back,9.0,Can't help but always think of Bewitched!! Love the color details to the reality
16 January 2021,"Fantastic, go in with an open mind!",10.0,"WandaVision is fantastic. People need to be patient and enjoy the ride, watch for the little things that pop up through the series as it sets up Marvel's phase 4. The styling is amazing with the detailing from each era of television sitcoms perfected. The real thing to watch is the fact that Wanda is the focus of this series. The story that unfolds for Wanda throughout the Avengers movies displays she is broken and if you know her comic storyline there is much more to come in terms of story, shock and the evolution of the character. Thank you Marvel and Disney for finding a great and unique way to tell the story."
18 January 2021,Only 2 episodes aired as yet.,7.0,I'm sure it will all become clear. But I have no idea what the premise of this show is yet. Visually it's very good. Episode 2 was much better than 1. Let's see where we go...
23 January 2021,Better not to create such shows,9.0,In all 3 episodes 90% of time it is sitcom with laughter tracks and in last 10% drops some interesting hints to retain viewer for the next one. Just old school strategy and more importantly very annoying.
16 January 2021,could this be anymore boring,2.0,Wow....this series was so hyped up...And failed spectaculary. I rather listen to golf on radio then to watch this show. You gotto be a special kind of bored to find this show funny or interesting enough to spend 5 min watching this. Boring....!!!!!
20 January 2021,Better than a 7/10,10.0,"For all the people that are giving a one star to ""even the score out"", I'm evening your score out so deal with it. Sure it doesn't deserve a 10 but it is much highter than a 7. If this is a 7 then all cw arrowverse shows should be a 5 and they are not, they are also a 7 and this show has much better quality, acting and a better story in just 2 episodes."
5 February 2021,Just because something is different doesn't make it automatically good...,1.0,"I'm a Marvel fan, but this is an old slow TV show at best. The last two Avengers movies are a 9 and 10. WandaVision is not even close. Sad but true. And yes, I get it, I just don't like the concept and presentation of WandaVision. For you who give the series a 9 and 10 - I'm happy for you. Enjoy."
17 January 2021,Over the top and unceasary,2.0,"Typical Disney slapstick style of comedy (late 90's to early 2000's style of typical garbage early teens sitcoms) I genuinely think Paul Bettany is a very underated actor, and this is really beneath him. But I guess the amount of money Disney would of ploughed into this garbage it must of been a attractive offer, Paul your better than this!!! And yet here are all of us muppets paying for a Disney+ subscription to be subjected to this.

Even from the get go it was hard to get a grasp of the characters if you haven't watched the movies

Realistically there should of been some kind of tie in with the movies as it is missing a complete narrative perspective from what happend in end game...

Maybe a bit of a bac story would of surficed such as wanda travelling back in time before thanks gets the mind stone and saving vision and her time device malfunctions on the way back and gets stuck in the shows era.....

Poor attempt at putting together that I was looking forward to watching in this current pandemic due to delays on films being released ect...

Please don't mess up the other potential ""needy"" series revolving the avengers ect...

You definitely need to rethink your storyboards and make it accessible to everyone who hasn't even watched a marvel film

Paul!!!!! Get on to your agent!!!!"
15 January 2021,A Trip!!!!,10.0,It's actually a trip to try to figure out what's going on with the show... That's the best part of the Marvel universe... I will continue to watch!
22 January 2021,First 3 episodes are amazing!,8.0,I absolutely love this show! The constant fear of something not right constantly keeps me intrigued and exited to see what's next. People are saying it's boring and I don't know what they expected?? Like the trailers showed what kind of show it was going to be. Do you want thanos to show up or something...?
16 February 2021,Enough with the laugh track!,1.0,"I get why they use the laugh track, especially for the first few episodes, but it's nauseating. Overwhelmingly nauseating! Especially in 2021. JUST STOP!!! It was a gimmick that ran too long.

If you wanted something entertaining, yet even more intriguing and clever, you should have hired Noah Hawley as a consultant at the very least."
15 January 2021,After watching Episode 4,7.0,"Haven't seen something this boring in a long long Time. This better pays off in Episode 3... that said I will change the rating if it does get better.

Changed the rating, a 7 for me so far, the first two episodes are still boring and dull."
16 January 2021,this show is definitely a 10,10.0,Best show i've seen in a while & i think i speak for all of us when i say that we definitely should get a season 2 right away. 🙏🙏
16 June 2021,Decent show BUT ...,5.0,"I cannot stand laugh-tracks in TV shows. Drives me ABSOLUTELY insane. I get that part of it is supposed to be a sit-com from years past but come on. Why would they put a laugh-track in a Marvel show?

I have yet to finish the series and I'm not sure I want to."
28 February 2021,DON'T WATCH IT. It's a waste of time.,3.0,"I immediately hated it and couldn't understand how this POS even exists. So I went to IMBD to see some feedback. Over and over the reviews say to get through the first 3 episodes and then it gets INCREDIBLE.

Well, I've seen all 8 episodes and I'm disgusted with myself for believing the hype.

One of the dumbest, unenjoyable drag outs in history."
26 February 2021,Awesome,10.0,Wanda is literally my favorite Marvel character right now.......Most powerful woman in Marvel i have ever seen..........magnificent.
22 February 2021,This is amazing,7.0,I have no words to express.This is a amazing show everyone should watch it
27 November 2021,Weird and with little substance,2.0,Just don't. First few episodes are ridiculously stupid in their 70's sitcom setting. Later episodes have their moments but they are far in between. Marvel should stick to movies.
17 February 2021,Bring the rain!!!!,1.0,Boring from the start..... Its not Bewitched...... It tries to get on the same road...... Unfortunately I liked Bewitched..... Equally I love Marvel...... In no way is this either.... Horrible!!!!
17 January 2021,Captivating build up and great acting,10.0,"It's pretty obvious that the show is not going to remain in it's black and white early 90s sitcom vibe. Even then, the quirky storyline, humour, and acting were amusing. It's a joy to watch Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany perform.

The show occasionally throws in subtle cues as to what might be really going on, and it won't be long before the show turns in to another action-packed guns blazing Marvel flick"
8 March 2021,"The best part of this show, was the fan theories!",7.0,
4 May 2021,The one problem with the show,9.0,
18 January 2021,Welcome to 1960's sitcom!,9.0,"The first two episodes of this show have been delightful. The first seems to be homage to Dick VanDyke while the second looks like Bewitched meets I Love Lucy. The comedy is cute, tight to the period, and tongue in cheek. The slow reveal of some sinister hidden plot works very well. The only complaint I have is the very long end credit sequence."
1 February 2021,"Totally oversimplified, terrible",1.0,"I have to admit, i only watched the first episode. It's trying to be a remake of classic sitcoms of the 50s, and it is failing miserably at that. Forced laughter, terrible jokes that should be deemed to gender biased to be used today. And all that using the backdrop of 2 of Marvel's more interesting characters. It could be so much, and maybe it will be later in the season. But there is no reason to suffer to that trash which was the first episode when you consider how much good TV is on these days."
17 January 2021,Its a show you have to watch and rewatch before you get all the details,10.0,"This is spoiler free but the episode are as short because it's made to resemble an old fashioned TV sitcom

You have to pay attention to all the details and the sounds.. The first 1 was supposed to be around the 50 and the 2nd during the 60.. They are both funny and used the same style of comedy I have a feeling that it will get alto better because the first 2 were just amazing but there is a lot of detail again that you will miss ..."
15 January 2021,Wandavision,10.0,Good Series must watch one of the best series of marvel
23 January 2021,It's been 3 episodes chill out,10.0,"Love when people write pointless reviews when we haven't even been shown the entire premise of the show, marvel wouldn't have spent $225 million on a show if it wasn't gonna be worth the ride, hold tight hooligans."
15 January 2021,Absolutely Incredible,,"Wandavision is a fun, delightful and amazing new take on the MCU if you haven't checked it out yet i highly suggest that you do!"
11 September 2022,WTF?!?!?!,2.0,
23 January 2021,"Long credits, Weird show",3.0,One of the weirdest slow developing shows I've ever seen. The credits are 20 percent or more of the show.
18 March 2021,So boring,1.0,"I want see so much this série but I get really disappointed. It's so boring and not funny, it's not a comics, not a series, for me it's garbage"
17 January 2021,Little puzzle pieces,9.0,"At first, the show seems silly, awkward, contrived, and cheap. However, something bigger is going on. The trailers allude to an evolution occurring through each episode. The end of each show give us little puzzle pieces, each piece revealing a bit more. I can't wait to see how it's going to unfold!!"
6 March 2021,Very very disappointing,5.0,Episode 1-8 might be some of the best story telling Marvel has ever done. Episode 9 however is a tremendous let down. It makes you as the viewer question why did I even bother watching this? It reminds me of how seasons 1-3 of battle star galactica were amazing and season 4 was a waste.
22 January 2021,3 eps review,1.0,
19 February 2021,worth noticing in the cast info,10.0,
15 January 2021,Good but I can't wait for later episodes,10.0,I like the sitcom era and it's truly amazing and nothing we have seen before from marvel studios.
15 January 2021,Amazing,10.0,"Wandavision is honestly amazing there is so much going on that makes you want more Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany do an amazing job working together their chemistry in this show is amazing, can't wait to see more!!!"
23 January 2021,I can't finish episode 1 to painful,2.0,"It seems like a bad sitcom, like b level. I know they can actor better but the acting is terrible does it get any better if I painful watch it?"
17 January 2021,Bad idea 4:3 ... avarage jokes.. Booring!,6.0,"It's clear what they try to do, but its not working for me, really really booring even annoying. I will keep watching because i expect it to get better, but this 2episodes are waste of my time, i expected to see sometin interesting or fun... they were neither."
15 January 2021,Don't listen to anyone! Two Episodes - Impossible to Rate!,,"It surely will need our PATIENCE. Let's wait and see what Phase 4 is gonna serve us.

Thank you Marvel for making us excited again! I believe in you."
19 February 2021,A lot of pump but little gum,2.0,After seven chapters I am still missing a superheroes series
17 January 2021,"Awful,terrible,boring,pointless, waste of time",1.0,This is so boring I don't even care what happens. It's obvious they are in some weird world or reality but this just falls flat. Waste of time
26 May 2021,"Great start, Terrible end",5.0,
15 January 2021,Perfect And Awesome MCU Project After AVENGERS ENDGAME And SPIDERMAN FAR FROM HOME,10.0,Great Show A Best Start For 2021 I Was Hyped For It But When I Watch It The Hype And Waiting Was Worth it Some People Will Hate It But Not Us Lovely Start Of MCU Phase 4 Unbelievable Experience Of First 2 Episode Season 1 I Hope It Will As Great As The Mandalorian and Hamilton And Many More Just Dont Spread Hate Brother and Sister Its Good Time To Enjoy A New Years Have A Good Day.
6 March 2021,It's not goodenough,7.0,"I think it's will be better if it's just a sitcoms,just a marvel film,didn't changed since Ironman.And Wanda looks really studied,but I love her."
15 January 2021,Very good!,10.0,
4 March 2021,"i really wanted to like it, i really do, but...",2.0,"I really thought there is a bigger plot waiting after watching first 3 episodes ( there isn't). they took a movie plot, added all kinds of boring stuff and made it into series. so after watching all that boring stuff , when a episode came to an end they gave an surprising element. the only thing i am surprised at is how all viewers forgot all about the fillers in between and calling it best series of all time. NO a couple of suprise elements doesn't make it a great series, it doesn't even make it a decent series. and there is no good background score as well, and please don't tell me you really liked the Agatha's song.

conclusion: should have made it as a movie not series."
15 January 2021,Not for everyone YET - but a step in the right direction.,5.0,"I'm really surprised by the negative reviews here, as me and my friends who like Marvel all really enjoyed this. I started watching, possibly expecting the usual shtick, but the mystery approach to this story has impressed me; it's a step up for Marvel. I understand if you don't like the humour or the style we've seen in the first two episodes, but thanks to releasing two episodes we can see how things are going to change. Not only will the style progress through the decades, but a mystery plot will emerge with the scenes in the trailer will arrive for all of us who crave action. It can be easy to judge episodes when they are released as slowly as they are here, but I'm sure as things progress there will be something for everyone - and these early days are a good move by Marvel to break out of their shell and try something new with their characters!"
16 January 2021,How to ruin Marvel characters?,1.0,"Very simple, what a waste ruining 2 great characters in the Marvel universe."
15 January 2021,MARVELOUS,10.0,"For 13 years, people cried that marvel is just creating same action stuff again and again and when they make something different, they get dissapointed. This is Original, Entertaining, Interesting, Unique and alot more. Writing is very strong and so is direction. Must Watch."
15 January 2021,Fantastic series ahead,10.0,Best series Marvel has created as a critic I love what Marvel has done with wandavision.
15 January 2021,"""How is anyone doing this sober""",1.0,"""How is anyone doing this sober"". An apt quote for the first two episodes of this show. So far, It's a substandard cross between Pleasantville and Legion. I'm sure it'll get going soon enough but it's not really grabbed my attention so far."
24 January 2021,Almost disrespectful to Marvel's legacy,3.0,"I head it will build up and unfold slowly... But the first 3 episode I watched so far are somewhat funny, but in such a cheesy and kitsch way that I felt it was a total disgrace to put such iconic characters into these ridiculous roles."
15 January 2021,Two episodes so far...,10.0,
17 January 2021,Love it,10.0,Great family show!! We loved it! Can't wait for more episodes!
5 February 2021,It sucks.,1.0,It sucks. laugh track is annoying the whole thing sucks.
21 January 2021,High concept my fat aunt!,2.0,"When Marvel were producing their own product we had highly original content well scripted, well acted and well presented. Under Disney's charge this has evolved to bizarre content, very poorly scripted, the actors are obviously trying their hearts out but the presentation plotting defeats everything. Why have we wasted two entire episodes to establish that the mains are inhabiting some sort of artificially constructed environment? That sort of nonsense can be handled in a matter of minutes. I watched the whole 1st episode expecting something to give but was bitterly disappointed. I recorded the 2nd issue so I wouldn't be tempted to open a vein and was wise to do so because I nearly wore the jump forward button out. Who approves this todge and what drugs are they taking? Please let me know because I want to know what to avoid if it's ever offered to me. I was quite ambivalent to the idea of Dismalney taking over MCU and I'm afraid that feeling so far appears to have been very well founded. The reason for scoring this as a 2 is the sum of the first two episodes; let's all hope I don't have to update to 3 because from then on I will have to start deducting points."
17 January 2021,Oh what stories will be told,9.0,
17 December 2021,A mix between Marvel and Tim Burton,7.0,
22 January 2021,I hope this first three episodes are preamble,1.0,
7 February 2021,If this wasn't Marvel... would anybody still be watching?,1.0,"Waited to watch until I could binge 5 episodes. Extremely disappointed. 30minute episodes. 25 minutes of nonsense 5 minutes of MCU relevance.

Tired of hearing how ""the next episode will blow my mind!"" Only to be let down.

But hey, it's Marvel so, keep drinking that Flavor-Aid :)"
16 January 2021,What were they thinking?,8.0,I don't know what the makers were thinking when they decided to go with this mess. I'm a big MCU fan but this is truly awful. What a waste of time I'll never get back
15 January 2021,a new breath,10.0,"Wandavision is what marvel needed to stop being repetitive in its products. To see wandavision you have to go with a new mentality, knowing that you are not going to see great action fights, but you will see a very trained and mysterious product."
15 January 2021,amazing,10.0,"Just watched the first 2 episodes, and i already think it's amazing, the curiousity and mystery behind it makes it so cool. 100% recommend"
10 March 2021,Just what i expected,10.0,"The show was very well put together, and just what i expected after seeing the trailers. Elizabeth Olsens acting is so refreshing, and Kathryn Hahn is so effortlessly funny. I really enjoyed the show, unique with lots of suprises."
26 January 2021,Peweee!!!,1.0,"I forced myself to watch the first 3 episodes. Well, 3 was definitely too many! I'd much rather get out my DVD's of Bewitched and really be entertained!"
15 January 2021,how is this only an 8,10.0,
24 January 2021,Cheap,4.0,"I've only watched the first episode, so can only review that. It is advertised as 29 minutes long, its actually 22 minutes with 7 minutes of credits. Shot entirely in black and white, supposedly to give the 50s sitcom vibe, this along with the misleading length, makes it appear quite miserly. I won't slate the content, there wasn't much to slate after all. I'll see how the series proceeds."
15 January 2021,Highly Disappointing,3.0,"That about covers it. Highly disappointing. That's really all I have to say about the first two eps but IMDb insists i write more. The canned laughtrack was atrocious, acting was horrid and over-the-top, even if they were trying to capture the late '50s, early '60s sitcom feel. Only those brief moments of ""reality"" was it interesting."
19 February 2021,everything on the control,10.0,Episode 7 was so good man I hyped I guess 8 and 9 th episode will best finish in mcu
15 January 2021,MMMMMMMMarveLLLLLLLLLLLLLL,9.0,"It sees the telekinetic and reality-warping Wanda and her enhanced android husband settled in the white-picket-fenced apparent idyll of Westview. Just completed my two episodes I want to watch once more, also super excited to watch upcoming episodes too...."
6 March 2021,It went from the grief sentence to Ralph Bohner. Good series even though.,8.0,
15 January 2021,Insulting,7.0,"How is it even possible to rate this crap? It is so redundant, so blatantly boring, so disconnected from fracking everything. The suspense lies in the good reviews."
27 February 2021,Boring or LAME? I can't decide,3.0,"To be fair, I've only seen 3 episodes. I HOPE It gets better. But so far, it's a horrible show. It could be a slow grow and get better. But so far, this show sucks. I was hoping for way more, given both their powers. Please Disney/Marvel, don't let me be sucked in any further without a better story to unfold."
5 February 2021,"Just a poorly remade 50's sitcom, not funny, just annoying.",1.0,"Held my nose through the entire first episode with its 1950's bad jokes and canned laughter. Couldn't stomach all the way through the second so after about half way jumped to the THIRD and more of the same garbage and gave up. I though maybe, just maybe, Disney would snap out of the 50's B&W bull and get to some actual Marvel Action Adventure without canned laughter. WHAT A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!"
7 August 2021,loved,10.0,"Absolutely loved this show. Starts of confusing and a little boring in black and white, but it certainly does pick up. Best of both worlds. Sitcoms and action. I mean elizabeth olsen am i right?"
16 June 2021,First serial,10.0,Frist impression was impressive. To be honest I never watch like this.
12 March 2021,Could have been a lot shorter...,2.0,"There wasn't enough story for a series. Could have covered everything as an ABC After School Special. Moves very slow and when the ""mysteries"" are revealed it's rather disappointing. Acting was over-the-top and very hammy. Much like series on the Disney Channel. Think of ""That's so Maven"". I fast forwarded through a lot of it. The grand finale fight was predictable. There were a couple of good scenes toward the end but too much bad stuff to get there. You can skip it since it adds nothing to the Marvel Universe storyline. Hope Disney does a lot better on the other planned series."
16 July 2021,#,4.0,You don't have to be long like this to tell this sort of story.
24 January 2021,I stopped watching it after 5 minutes,1.0,"This is really, really bad. 'Not clever and not remotely interesting. Nuff said!"
23 May 2021,Boring,2.0,It was boring till last episode very slow web series.
7 April 2022,WandaVision sucks.,1.0,"No spoilers...seriously WANDASVISION sucks. I get that they were trying to do something different and they did. Sorry Marvel but everything you make isn't good. Need proof? Iron fist. Luke Cage. The Defenders. The fantastic four, rise of the silver surfer and now WandaVision."
25 January 2021,Bad and boring,3.0,
8 February 2021,Just awful,2.0,"Reading the reviews, I can't believe this is the same show I watched. The first two episodes were mind numbingly dull and it gets slightly better, but not much."
23 January 2021,3 mins ep1 4 mins ep2 8 mins ep 3 relevant,5.0,"Getting better and a snails pace.m. Feels like when they focus on the plight of there situation, quite amazing. The problem is that in about an hour and a half, there is about 15 minutes (being generous) of actual importance to the story. This is their vision (excuse the pun) so ill just see how it all unfolds. Wanda is one of my favourites and i hope the rest of the shows have more substance per show than wasted space. 🤞"
28 March 2021,Brilliant storyline and amazing characters!,10.0,Brilliant and creative story line by the writers. Endgame Wanda lives up to expectations!
15 January 2021,Awesome,10.0,"The reason why I'm saying this is awesome because the MCU once again proves how great of content they make! The WandaVison television series has potential of becoming as great as the MCU's Netflix series such as Punisher, DareDevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones & Iron Fist. Probably much better."
3 March 2021,Wow petrio wow getting better in each episode,10.0,
20 February 2021,Insane. Genius. Like nothing you have seen before .,10.0,
16 January 2021,Obnoxious,1.0,This is the worst show I've ever watched! No idea what they were thinking or drinking when they wrote and produced this show. Stan Lee must be rolling in his grave. What a disgrace to Marvel😞
11 February 2021,WANDAVISION IS GREAT,10.0,It's in the title! What a wonderful Show! Breath taking!
17 March 2021,Rotten,3.0,"When the first 6 episodes are rotten and slow, I'm not even wanting to wait for the next season.. Thumbs down..."
15 January 2021,What a Delightful Vision,10.0,It is just amazing they both acted according to the decade and its culture and the cliffhanger in the second episode is something to WANDAring about.
13 February 2021,Another string that ties the MCU together.,4.0,"If you really wanna enjoy this show you'll have to watch 21 movies beforehand. You'll have to be a comic fan. Once you've completed both of the condition this is actually a wonderful show. Specially the cinematography. The actors are wonderful too, no complains on that part either.

Overall a great show. Love it."
15 March 2021,Horrible show,1.0,I just don't know how this is getting this high rates
28 January 2021,O Dear,2.0,"I really have tried to like this. I'm of the age that grew up with Bewitched and I dream of Genie and these were pieces of art compared to this heap of dung. Watched three episodes now the best thing I can say is its now in colour and widescreen. There seems unlike the aforementioned shows no real chemistry between Wanda and Vision, which ruins the show. I would prefer to watch 6 Seasons of 2 Broke Girls than another episode of this."
16 January 2021,Both the episode are too small to our hunger! Mostly comedy 😑,9.0,"Two avengers, two powerful avengers in a comedy series! May be it is not of comedy genres overall, we have to see it full. However, as a marvel lover anyone must watch it!"
8 February 2021,It started slow,9.0,"The show started slow, and the first two episodes were ""too cheezy"", then everything changes, and the pace picks up after episode 3.

It looks like we are on for a rollercoaster, and so far I really liked what I have seen.

Do not get distracted with the early looks."
17 March 2021,Average TV Shows,6.0,"First of all, the sitcoms is not for me, I was often fast forwarding in the first 3 episodes. In the 4th episode I though it would be interesting until I relize I always hate agents of S.H.I.E.L.D plot either. I was glad that this show is not Shield and has more complex plots, so I keep watching it. But again why are all these characters so selfish in this show? and totally the opposite to MCU characters that I like.

Wanda was introduced as a teenager in Avengers movies, but not this naive. It feels like her character is going backwards for sake of phase 4. For me, it's just average tv shows online, nothing spectacular.

If you are a die hard Marvel fans, especially agents of SHIELD fans, this show is for you. But for me, it's not."
17 January 2021,Loved the episodes,10.0,This show was so good!! and before you judge remember we have just seen 2 episodes there are more episodes and the storytelling is so good!!!
16 January 2021,Weired in a good way,10.0,I am more curious about this series this like a sitcom but its weired
15 January 2021,Just feel the ride.,8.0,
1 March 2021,"What a GEM of a Show!! What is Grief, if not love persevering?",9.0,
19 March 2021,Only people who love Marvel will enjoy this show.,4.0,
20 March 2021,False advertising in show form,5.0,
15 January 2021,Great TeleVision!,8.0,"This is an amazing start to what could be a very interesting and unique storyline that Marvel has created. It is both a love letter to older eras of television, and a superhero story that is so much different to anything we've seen before. The 50s style of sitcom might not be everyone's favorite start to the series, but it is pulled off with confidence. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are great together and really work as a Honeymooners-esque couple. But do not be fooled, the eeriness of the world they live in hints at further danger that lies ahead through the series.

I think Marvel have done a great job with this series to start and I cannot wait to see where this show goes with the combination of other styles of TV sitcoms and superhero action."
13 March 2021,I don't understand people that say ita a good show!,1.0,
29 January 2021,I thought they really messed up wonder women 1984 but then I watch this,1.0,"I am writing a review while watching the second episode 2, this is just horrible and I don't wanna watch anymore but its a lockdown and I'm bored as hell. I don't wanna miss any marvel easter eggs so FML."
12 March 2021,Already have seen this from Disney,1.0,"Did anybody catch that this was Disney's 1998 Halloweentown rehashed? The town people all hexed, the seemingly ""good"" guy, okay gal, that turns out to be the villain (in practically the same costume), the realization of the main character that she really is a witch after all. I could go on but honestly... this is the best story line they could come up with? The first couple of episodes were promising with the mix of classic TV themes/sets but it quickly devolved into been there/done that. Really all they were missing was a Debbie Reynolds character and it would have been old home week."
13 February 2021,Extremely Excited,8.0,"With the slow beginning and the mysterious middle, how could you know be excited for the end? While being a fan of all MCU content, I have faith this will not disappoint."
1 September 2021,"Only for ""fanboys""",2.0,"Only watch if you're a Marvel ""fanboy"", which I'm not, otherwise it doesn't make any sense. First few episodes are pointless any annoying, got a bit better when the mystery is revealed, then it's just hocus pocus nonsense and CGI after that."
7 February 2021,it's just terrible,1.0,"Don't believe the hype, this show is just plain awful."
27 January 2021,Waste of time,1.0,Great way to waste your time. Not entertaining at all. This may be a great show to watch if you are having a hard time falling asleep.
5 May 2022,Convoluted,6.0,
19 January 2021,"Special, Unique",9.0,
23 February 2021,"Disney changed Daredevil, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage for this??",2.0,"It's sad to see the course that Disney is taking with WandaVision. The show is a bit interesting but a lot of silly. They are taking away the serious part of Avengers with this show. I mean, a sitcom?? is kind of ridiculous and I hate Disney cancelled previous Marvel netflix shows like DareDevil and the Defenders to do this. At least, they could have let Defenders to go on over Netflix because is a different target audience. I hoped Disney+ could re-take those shows but whatching what they are doing with WandaVision, tha hope is losing everyday."
24 January 2021,BORING,2.0,"Not worth the watch, it doesn't get better no matter how long you watch it. The sitcom jokes are unfunny and the only people liking this are hardcore MCU fans who don't care about quality and only quantity"
16 March 2021,"If you don't watch a lot of TV, you'd rate this show higher than I have",6.0,"I have watched a lot of good television. My top 5 shows all time are: Game of Thrones, The Expanse, The Last Kingdom, Breaking Bad, and True Detective (S1). There are far, far better shows out there that I haven't just listed where WandaVision can't compete with them.

WandaVision is a set up show, plain and simple. The show is interesting if you want a full season of a mystery that is only as engaging as your interest in the characters and love of how the show relies on nostalgia of old TV eras. Aside from a long, drawn out plot involving Wanda and Vision and some boring side characters trying to determine what is happening in the story, there isn't much to enjoy. There are cheesy moments and there are moments where I think the show wanted me to care about characters, and there is some action here and there. I didn't find the character development to be enjoyable to watch.

But the biggest problem of the show is its terrible pacing. This show should have been 5 episodes maximum. With the 9 episodes, its drawn out, boring, not engaging unless you are frothing from the mouth for anything Marvel.

Go watch some excellent Television, perhaps some of the shows I have listed, come back and give this another watch. This show is barely a 6. If I could give it a more accurate score, its a 5.85 out of 10."
15 January 2021,Amazing,10.0,"Wandavision clearly begins by paying homage to old TV sitcoms, using a clever narrative, jokes from the time, audience, practical effects and etc., the episodes are very captivating and mysterious, in some very dark and weird moments, in addition to containing some hidden Easter eggs. It is a very bold return and unlike anything we've seen in the MCU ... I loved it so much, looking forward to the next eps !!!"
22 February 2021,This show!,9.0,This show had no right to be as good as it is! I don't even like Wanda or Vision.
7 February 2021,Don't believe what you see!!!,10.0,
17 January 2021,Ok I get it but 2 or more episodes for a twist intro is too much!!,1.0,I understand that Marvel wants to do it differently but this is just not good at all... I hope somwthing is happening but to use 2 episode of my time for a serie I have been waiting too long for is not worth it. Not for a Marvel fan during a pandemic. I think the idea is stupid and I hope whoever had the idea and the one accepting it will get fired. I mean it. We want Marvel so give us some Marvel...
3 June 2022,Please don't waste your time!!!,1.0,I love almost anything on TV but this was honestly one of the worst shows I've ever seen. What were they thinking??? It's a Brady Bunch ripoff at best but definitely a complete and total waste of time. I watched the entire season and I wish I had all of that time back. Brutal from the first episode and somehow it managed to get worse. I feel like it a scientific experiment to see how much garbage viewers would put up with.
7 April 2021,What's with the negative reviews?,7.0,"Most of the negative reviews are coming from Marvel fans who are only used to explosions. I'm not gonna say it's a masterpiece but it was a really good, original idea that worked on an artistic and thematic level. I would give this a 7 (can't give it more than that) but I definitely don't understand the negative reviews."
17 January 2021,It's perfect,10.0,"It's perfect I loved everything about the series First of all when I saw the first two chapters I understood what Marvel wanted to do, I personally liked the series a lot, and I liked how they adapted the type of comedy from the 50s and 60s and I'm dying to see the chapter of The 70s for me the series I think is going a good way, people criticize the comedy and the truth is I don't know what they expected because that is the comedy of those decades and I really like how the series progresses, in my opinion simply You cannot judge a series by its first two chapters, and believe me it is not the only series that has a bad start"
22 January 2021,Dreadful,1.0,
17 January 2021,Terrible,,"Hated it, there was nothing to even get my attention, let alone hold it. Worse than star wars resistance"
19 September 2021,It is good to watch,7.0,It is good web series but i think story at end could be better Wanda defeated villian by doing thing which villian can do to her way before But excepting perfect story is foolish thing So overall it is good.
30 January 2021,I just dont know,7.0,"Watching a serie is difficult, if you are not trapped in the first one, the serie is doom! The first 3 episodes does not trapped any one... While the 4th is good, I trully beleaved the 4th episode should be the first one"
25 December 2021,Tryhard Piece,2.0,"Jokes so easy to foretell and bleak that it hurts. Artificial laugh tracks on top are incredibly annoying. The overdone acting does suit the old-fashioned touch, but is definitely not my thing. I tried my best to watch longer, but gladly opted out."
6 November 2023,It's fine I guess?,4.0,
24 January 2021,Really bad,1.0,"We all know how bad old sitcoms used to be. It's funny to mock them for about 5 minutes, having to endure how bad they are to get to something better, a plot twist or something great is not worth the pain. After 3 episodes im done."
26 January 2021,Complete waste of time,1.0,"Do yourself a favour and don't wach this silly, stupid show."
15 January 2021,Great and Will get better...Must Watch!!,10.0,"Great to see Marvel cinematic universe started making Series.
Pilot was good and tried to settle into the 50s.
Episode 2 is a huge improvement and things start to change from here.
whole setting and casting are good.
Ep 1 was bit annoying with the unnecessary laugh tracks but from Ep2 everything is fine.
-Must watch and Recommended"
13 February 2021,Love!!!,10.0,"Best show ever! Slow at first setting it all up, but it gets better and better. I'm hooked and I hate waiting for new episodes to come out."
2 August 2021,BLACK AND WHITE 50's TV,10.0,"I'd say that this first TV show released in Disney Plus is the best (so far) acting is excellent, Paul and Lizzie are splendid actors. The way the show starts with the 50's sitcom show is awesome and then how it turns into the classic MCU story is excellent. Please don't listen to those criticize the first episodes because they are a MASTERPIECE!"
24 January 2021,Garbage,8.0,
9 March 2021,Worst of all mcu content,1.0,Disappointing show...worst of all mcu content...The incredible hulk and thor dark world is way better than this.....I think mcu shouldn't play with fans mind.😡😡😡
15 January 2021,I love it.,10.0,"It's fun, eyeball-catching and weird at the same time. It leaves the audience and viewers wanting more and it's fun to see Wanda's made-up world slowly falling apart with the reality stepping in."
3 July 2021,Don't see the hype.,3.0,Only episode I enjoyed was the final other then that jut show was slow and kinda boring.
4 February 2023,Very good show.,,"Good characters, premise, implementation, special effects. It's enjoyable all the way through. Elizabeth of course is wonderful, this could've easily been a several season show, much like Loki, and is in fact more enjoyable than the last several ""MCU"" movies.

That said if they can't manage to dedicate enough resources to keep something otherwise successful going (Season 2+) I would recommend avoiding any MCU-based medias at this point as they're just going to bait and switch even when they do manage to make something worth your time, such as with this.

It's a real shame as this is a real winner.

8/10 show, 10/10 for Elizabeth.

-20/10 for parent company and 'one-season only of an otherwise excellent show' nonsense."
5 February 2021,"Not funny as sitcom, not good as action show...until episode 4",5.0,"The first 3 episodes are useless and boring. As a sitcom is not funny, rarely will make you draw a smile, as action show... has nothing of action... all this until episode 4.

On episode 4 you will understand and know everything, turning 3 first episodes useless and boring, a complete waste of time."
5 March 2021,Disappointed,6.0,"A whole month of waiting, all these tensions built, all theses theories, Just not worth it at the end Just feel like a normal show. Nothing actually feels like Marvel Studio"
27 January 2021,Watch the whole damn series PLEASE,10.0,"People are complaining that the show has an outdated 50s style when THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT! Each episode replicates sitcoms from each decade from the 50s to the 2000s. And they don't just do that for the aesthetic. Elizabeth Olsen said in an interview that there's an actual reason why this is how the show is. If some of you were actual Marvel fans or took the time to do any research whatsoever, you would know that the entire thing is purposely and is 100% leading towards a bigger picture. Please, watch at least the first 4 episodes before running to to this site with premature opinions.

Other than that, I think the entire thing is great."
15 January 2021,Go into this with an open mind,7.0,"As an MCU lover and a Marvel comic lover, I'm no stranger to the different approaches to these characters. While I wouldn't suggest that this is up there with Endgame or Infinity war, it is in it's own category by itself. If you go to watch this thinking it is going to be like a typical MCU movie, you will be dissapointed. However, if you take it for what it is, it is good. The first two episodes have layed the ground work to tell a story. It will be slow at first like all series are. I had the same view about the Mandalorian which was a major success. Wandavision has definitely left me asking questions and wanting more. I wouldn't give it a 10 no, niether a 1 or a 2. Too many slandering and hyping reviews out there where as this is my honest opinion."
24 January 2021,"Waste of time,like a cheesy Bewitched!!",1.0,"Obviously Marvel have more money than sense to club together this cross between Bewitched and I dream a genie, but with no humour or wit!!"
17 January 2021,Who is this supposed to appeal to?,1.0,"I couldn't make it past the first episode. It was like a badly acted I Love Lucy episode, only without the comedy."
9 February 2021,These two barely met in Avengers...,1.0,So how do they have all these histories? Story line is not very logical.
17 January 2021,The secret lies within the jokes,10.0,"The first 3 episodes were suppose to be a old sitcom idea where the real plot is hidden in the jokes, however what I did not expect is that the jokes are actually pretty funny."
4 May 2021,BEST THING MARVEL HAVE MADE,10.0,Best tv show ever started kinda slow then in the middle it started with the action and at the last it was the best last episode ever MUST WATCH!!!
28 January 2021,Third episode... overstaying its welcome,8.0,"Try to endure 3 episodes. I think it's time to drop this one. Not really my cup of coffee. If you enjoy these 3 episodes, please continue. If you watched it expecting a different turn, better wait until it does, then binge it."
6 February 2021,Killing Me Slowly,10.0,"The fact that I have to wait each week for the next episode to drop as the mystery becomes darker, more tangled, stranger, and scarier than I ever predicted is the equivalent of stabbing me in the gut. Emotionally speaking. Everything we were promised and more. Does not disappoint. It might be safe to say that Wanda is the most tragic character in all of film history-everything I wanted from The Dark Phoenix and Joan from X-Men wrapped in a thrilling Marvel Red package, with a golden Iron Man bow on top."
15 January 2021,I Wandanother Episode,10.0,"I do not recall what the inside of a movie theater looks like. This past year I watched Frozen probably 10 times. I have no kids, but Olaf cracks me up and the songs are catchy. Don't judge you know it's true. The past year has been an endless stream of TV and Movies I have seen countless times before. Then one day, out of the abyss, I hear Disney is releasing new content! I prance around like Charlie when he finds the golden ticket, singing 'Daydream Believer' in my sleep (from trailer #2). I haven't been so excited for a TV-Show since the last season of Game of Thrones, which coincidentally is when my love for cheap wine began to manifest. Did I have high hopes? Yes. Counting down the seconds for the release? Yup. I was ecstatic. With such high hopes, I prepared myself for the possibility of a train-wreck-sitcom-action-superhero TV-Show version of Hancock. This show is the exact opposite. Funny, clever, and an entirely new direction for Marvel, shying away from their cookie-cutter hero movies we all know. The acting, casting, and exceptional writing comes together to create a funny, action filled sitcom with Olsen and Bettany's chemistry at the helm. Their sitcom style of acting is better than I expected, and the show does a really good job of balancing superhero aspects with a fun old fashiony sitcom vibe. So yes, I had high hopes, but they were exceeded from episode one. Keep it up Disney and I suppose I will sign up for another year subscription... You beautiful, greedy SOB's."
6 March 2021,It gets better,8.0,The first two episodes were tedious but do yourself a favor and stick with it. We hit episode three and I was fully onboard.
15 January 2021,Incredible,10.0,"We are only two episodes in but Jac Schaeffer definitely has a handle on everything and knows exactly what she's doing. The writing is immaculate and the acting from Olsen and Bettany is wonderful, balancing the retro sensibilities with modern nuances that you could blink and miss. I can't wait to see how the season unfolds because it's clear that there are levels to this show and it's clearly going to explode the MCU wide open."
17 January 2021,A pain to watch...,1.0,"I couldn't finish the first episode...I will try to give it another shot later, but so far there's nothing I liked. Slow, boring and Monochromatic...."
23 January 2021,Don't give up on it,10.0,
17 January 2021,Slow-Burn,10.0,"People don't understand the fact that the whole point of the show is that it's supposed to be a Slow-Burn.. It's unfair to judge it even before all episodes come out. And to those who say it feels too cringe and cheap, remember this is the most expensive show ever made so there's definitely something that's coming.. Talking about the show, i love how they recreated the sitcoms with such perfection! Everyone's performance is amazing, especially Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and Kathryn Hahn! The sinister elements that pop up in between the sitcom world are easily the highlights of the first two episodes and im the more the show progresses, the more we're going to find out what's really going on.. The writing is extremely clever, the direction is top notch and the execution is beyond perfection. The only criticism for this could be that it's being released weekly and it seems to be a little slow which might cause a lot of people's interest, but hang on to it, do not loose hope because something big is definitely coming!"
19 January 2021,Best Marvel Show,10.0,I loved the way marvel studios represented the character of Wanda and Vision in this mini series. The show is very amazing and entertaining. This show starts the MCU Phase 4 in a very clever way. The sitcom part of this show is very funny. And the Action of this show is on another level. The VFX of this show is literally amazing and mind blowing. Finally a show with funny content and superb action scenes. I loved the role of Paul Bettany as Vision in this amazing show of Marvel Studios.
26 January 2021,Don't Be Deceived By The Initial Episodes,8.0,"After watching the first two episodes I couldn't understand why this show was ever given such a high rating but after watching various breakdowns on Youtube my mind is blown and it's all clear now. There are a bunch of hidden messages throughout this entire show some subtle, others are clear as day. I know the beginning is kinda slow but I can tell this is show is going to blow our minds I can feel it!"
26 February 2021,Marvel should add more time,6.0,"The episode is too short only 30 minutes something, compare to other series which runs around an hour"
15 January 2021,Classy Actors in a Clever show,9.0,Olsen and Betany are 2 very classy actors who could easily have been superstars in the heydays of Hollywood. They are completely believable as sitcom characters of the 50's and 60's. 2 episodes in with only the faintest of hints at a deeper story. Can't wait for the big reveal.
16 January 2021,Garbage,1.0,"Garbage, absolutely garbage... I will not bother with episode 2... What a waste of time...

Sack the one that approved this project.

And why do the review need to be so long?"
15 January 2021,I can't wait for more WandaVision!,10.0,"We've only seen 2 episodes, but i already love this series. As a comic book fan, this truly gives some House of M feels, and that's amazing. Elizabeth and Paul deliver an hilarious performance, emmy-deserver, and there's also pretty dark moments, so I think something big is coming. People giving this a 1 or a 2, you truly have no idea."
17 March 2021,💔,4.0,
18 January 2021,7 so far,7.0,After two episodes I'm definitely intrigued! Very different take compared to anything in the MCU so far. Not really sure how anyone can say anything negative about it with 2 episodes down. Could it go south?? Sure! Cant say too much bc there isn't a lot to go on yet. Check it out and please... do not listen to any of the reviews until you watch it!
24 January 2021,1/3 of season gone and????,1.0,Just a bunch of credits and 0 action at all.... They must to understand that this is a premium content. So.. Where is it? Really frustrated with path that Vision get til here. A very important character simply tossed away on entire MCU!
10 September 2023,That's why it's Disney style but not Marvel!,5.0,"This could have been a lot more interesting, but unfortunately this is another mediocre and overrated show.

The concept is good with a little comedy, but most of the series is boring and despite the episodes being short!

The last two episodes aren't that bad, but it's just not enough to make the series and the story as good as the other Marvel movies for example and isn't really worth spending time on to watch.

The cast is good but the script is not. The cinematography is excellent, but that is simply not enough anymore, the special effects are not enough to make the show interesting. Unfortunately, another in a series of mediocre generic TV shows."
15 February 2021,Awful,3.0,I'm a big Marvel fan so was excited to watch this but this show is almost unwatchable. I would not recommend you waste your time investing beyond episode 1.
23 January 2021,"Move along, nothing to see here...",1.0,"After watching the first two episodes then I have to say I am extremely disappointed with the low quality lacklustre performances. The script is idiotic and the acting, if you can call it such, is so poor that it is boring and annoying. The added canned laughter also adds to the low quality - adding laughter when nothing funny is happening just exasperates the lack of any ideas by the production team. All the characters are wooden, bland and boring stereotypes just further adding to the dumbing down that this show induces. I can't see how any MARVEL fan will enjoy this nonsense as it is even too dumb for children to watch and the only achievement by the show is to destroy the characters of Wanda & Vision who will now just be seen as a joke for evermore.

The budget for each episode was reported to be a massive $25 million which makes it the most expensive television series in history. The end product implies the budget is actually more like 25 dollars! This puerile rubbish looks like it was written by 6 year old, in about 10 minutes and is an insult to the MARVEL universe and all MARVEL fans!

If I could give this show zero stars then I would but the lowest score is one star which I begrudgingly gave. Let's hope that this is not a sign of the ""quality"" of any future MARVEL projects otherwise their fan base will just dwindle away.

Update: after 8 episodes and it is still a boring, lacklustre show. Only reason I still watch it is because I am a huge MARVEL fan and don't want to miss anything but if this is a taste of what MARVEL are going to be doing then maybe it is time to turn to the darkside and favour DC..."
15 January 2021,Not what you'd expect from the MCU....,5.0,
9 April 2021,Mehh,,I don't understand how this show got so many good ratings. The first three episodes were really bad. It started to get better after that but still it wasn't amazing as some people say. The ending was meh.
5 March 2021,The series disappointed fans,5.0,The first 8 episodes were awesome. I was so crazy to know that what will happen in the finale. But after watching the finale i'm so disappointed not only me all mcu fans are disappointed. We didn't expected this kind of ending. There's so many unanswered questions they left in the finale. The writing of finale is good but not that good as all fans expected.
20 January 2021,"This is obviously a slow burner, don't rate it too early!",10.0,"I'm going to be absolutely honest and say that the first two episodes completely went over my head. I didn't look too much into trailers and the commentary that came with it when the hype train began so had no clue what I was walking into, probably similar to a huge amount of the marvel cinematic universe fanbase that don't know that much about the comics and other characters that are in the wider Marvel Universe.

I can completely understand where people are coming from giving it bad ratings for being boring so early after not knowing the complete picture of the show and it was definitely a risk on their part by only having two episodes to watch instead of a full season to fill in the blanks.

In saying that, I have totally changed my view on the show (which was mainly being bored or confused) after reading threads on reddit and watching YouTube explanations on what is actually happening with Wanda. There's an insane amount of subtle hints flowing through every line of dialogue and it's actually pretty impressive once you have it explained to you this way and how they've hidden everything in plain sight. I really encourage people to do the same that I have and give the show a chance as I think it's really going to kick up a few notches and have us frothing for Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness once the season has ended.

Just my 2cents!"
6 February 2021,"A Great Show, Ruined.",6.0,
17 January 2021,7* with great expectations,9.0,"Look the I know it's been a slow 2 episodes but the foundation's have to be set. Not everything in the show is obvious and on the surface. A true fan would have noticed a lot of hints where this show is going. You just have to have an open mind. I think the 1* reviews are a bit over the top as is a 10*. The trailers suggest a lot of action and excitement, you've just got to give it time to build up. I think it's a very clever layered series that's going to deliver as an MCU feature expects too. (Watch the Easter egg reviews on YouTube to know what you missed in the first two episodes)"
21 November 2023,I want to say a few words about this movie,7.0,"I really want to say something. You never see a girl you haven't seen before. Who hasn't seen the journey? What journey have I never seen? What journey have you never seen? What do you mean by that? Who haven't you seen? What haven't you seen? You haven't seen me. What? That's a great journey you've never seen before. Who has never seen a great journey? I've seen everything I haven't seen. What? That's a great woman's pseudo-journey that you've never seen before. Ah, ah, I've seen everything. I've seen countless movies. No, I haven't seen you. No, I haven't seen you. What are you. What? What? This is a great journey that you have never seen before. Who has never seen a great journey? What journey have I never seen before? I have seen too many movies. What do you mean by that? You've never seen the great journey. What have I seen? You've never seen it. I've seen it. What is it? It's a great journey that you've never seen before. How can it be a great journey that I've never seen before? What have I seen? I won't see you. What are you. So what do you mean by that? What? Never seen the great map? You say who hasn't seen it? I've seen everything. What? You've never seen it, Wade. I've seen it. I won't see you. What? You you don't know. I don't know. No, you don't do it. What you've never seen you what you said about me you don't you don't do it. What? I've never seen anyone. I've seen everything. No, no, no. I've seen everyone you said. No, I haven't seen anyone. Why is that a great force you've never seen before? Who hasn't seen it? I've seen everything. No, I haven't seen it. I've seen you. You haven't seen it. No, I can't say it. Do you know? You can't talk about me at all. I've seen everything. I don't exist. I've never seen me. A great journey. I've seen everything. What great journey you've never seen. What have I seen? I haven't seen. I've seen. I won't see. I say who won't. No. What is this great map that you have never seen? Who has never seen the great rain? I have seen it all. What I have seen it? It is better that I have never seen it. Just like this I have also seen it. What is it? He said you have never seen great, who has not seen what you have not seen, who has not seen what you have not seen, who has not seen ah, I have seen all what, you have never seen I have seen no, no, no. What's the greatest journey you've ever seen, and who rushed it? What, you never did?"
1 February 2021,"Seems promising, BUT",,"I like the show and waiting for the plot to unfold, but why is a 28 minutes considered an episode?? Too short not worth the weekly wait. For me i will wait after the show ends and continue watching..."
28 March 2021,Boring,1.0,"It Should me a short movie or 3 series long. First 5 episodes are to random and don't get you involved. Most Disney is 9+ but this is slow. I can't see way anyone would give this above 4 unless they are trying to be - with it!!!

I would love to be the producer of this getting paid £££ for a load of cra..."
28 March 2021,Bad show,5.0,"Horrible actors, story line not intriguing at all, marvel needs to work some more on their tv shows."
30 January 2021,"Lazy writing total ripoff, perhaps if I was 5yo. five",5.0,"I started episode 3 today and shut it off. Nothing in this is original. I'm a Marvel fan. However, from what they've released so far, I feel confident saying, Stan Lee would have rejected a cameo role. Perhaps if they released the entire series at once it would make more sense. This is like receiving two pages of a comic book per episode. Unfortunately you would have read those 2 pages in a another companies comic book years before. Lazy writing, archaic childish humor, cheap production with 15 minutes of content makes Wandavision not worth my time. This is not up to Marvel standards. I've seen better web episodes parodies than this show."
30 July 2021,Anyone ratting over 5stars was paid by disney,4.0,Does not make any sense even from a timeline doesn't explain how 2 avengers ended up in a ditch.
23 January 2021,Great show.,10.0,This show is great it is a really fun mystery and I would definitely recommend it.
3 May 2022,What was the point of this entire show????,6.0,"Why does this show exist? Doesn't add any significance to the Marvel universe... there's good CGI and all, but fail to see the point of the show...? Would have rather watched the actual original story of Wanda."
16 January 2021,Cheap sitcom,1.0,"Nothing to do with real Wanda and Vision, it's just a crap of a sitcom! Don't waste time watching it!"
1 June 2021,Worst thing marvel have made EVER! FACT!!!,4.0,
16 March 2021,You lost it somewhere along the way,6.0,"First of all, why did you feel the need to put us through the first three episodes? It was exhausting! There was no need to make them so long and detailed. All you needed was to include a few easter eggs in one episode and that's it! I almost gave up. Then, episodes 4-6 were such a thrill that I couldn't wait for the next one! They were perfect - insightful, smart, inventive and finally, it all came together. Why would you ruin that by adding random hero abilities and unnecessary characters? I mean, a witch? Seriously?! It's so DC-like, they add everything in the movie hoping that something will stick and will be a selling point so they end up creating a huge mess. Focus, people! You can do better."
26 February 2021,Please ignore the early reviews!,8.0,"Please don't let yourself get put off by the early reviews of this show that were left on here after 2-3 episodes by people who didn't have the patience to see how this show played out. Yes, it starts slow but it's all laying the foundations for a fantastic story that is brilliantly well told. A must watch for fans of the MCU"
17 January 2021,Everything I could of wanted,8.0,
15 January 2021,Shocked!,10.0,"I had high expectations for this show, and they were definitely met. After Avengers: Endgame I was worried for how Marvel would keep their content fresh and new, but they have done it here with WandaVision! The acting is amazing. Directing is amazing. Great writing. I really cannot fault this show. WATCH IT!"
29 January 2021,there are pros and cons,7.0,
17 January 2021,This is the mystery box that JJ Abrams popularised,7.0,"Lots of people here getting turned off the sitcom parody aspect of the show. People, you need to pay attention... There are so many things that I happening visually that you need to keep your eyes peeled.Don't dismiss the show just because it is of short length or because you don't like old timey shows. Don't expect 30 40 minute episodes. Just imagine it as a movie that is split into segments. It's not like you are paying for each of the segments. You are paying one lump sum amount every month. So have patience and don't give up on it. It has a creepy,surreal,mysterious atmosphere under the the layer of cheery happiness and comedy"
2 April 2021,Unexpected,1.0,I watched the first episode Then stopped Any recommendations to continue?
15 January 2021,desparate shilling is the unfortunate result of the popularity of this franchise,7.0,"The first 2 episodes are just a boring 50s ""comedy"" with a laugh track. At this point all we can do is hope something better to come soon."
16 January 2021,Hmmmm,,Well the first 2 episodes are shocking to say the least and I have absolutely zero idea what the show is about other than the trailers which didn't explain much. I'm hoping the rest of the series begins to make sense and get much better as I only watched it as nothing else was on otherwise I would have actually switched it off. Let's keep our fingers crossed it improves
27 March 2021,Decently enjoyable but missed potential,5.0,"Decent show. I enjoyed the acting and the time jumping. I grew up watching Nick at Nite so it was nice to see some of the parodies of older classic shows. And they are done well.

Overall the show builds up the characters and the plot well with suspense and anticipation.

But then they interject 2 recap episodes that provide nothing but spelling out what has already happened. Do we really need a recap every hour? Even 10 year olds can follow the plot.

Then you get the final 2 episodes and while they are quite entertaining they fall very short of what this show could have been.

Essentially it is a Scarlet Witch origin story done in very typical Marvel fashion. With the very straightforward ending, I don't really understand what all the time jumping was even for? It really just feels more like a gimmick and a ""fun project"" for the actors and directors than any significant plot point

It just felt very thin and VERY drawn out with no big reveals or anything substantial. With Disney launching like 80 new Marvel shows and movies in coming months and years, if this is the slow and small pace they are using, it will all be major time suck.

Unfortunately even though I did enjoy this show, it was a waste of time in relation to MCU and I have boycotted watching anymore Disney+ Marvel shows because I do not feel they will connect well or propel story archs forward."
25 May 2022,What?,4.0,"I watched the whole thing before commenting on here.

I don't get it. Maybe because I've never watched a marvel movie, maybe because I don't care for magic and fantasy.

I would have, however, appreciated if they could've added some explanatory bits for those among us who are not well-acquainted with the Marvel universe!

Other than that, the visuals are nice and the casting is well thought of."
21 December 2021,Decent with Anticlimactic Ending,5.0,
19 January 2022,The movie is not for everyone.,6.0,"I often heard positive reviews about the series, they recommended it without sparing words. So, he came himself - turned on.

And that's it, an old-style movie that I couldn't watch. I tried to watch the first episode, but it didn't work."
19 January 2022,My opinion,3.0,"So, WandaVision is as funny as it could be and that's completely different from what we've seen in Marvel till date. Except for this shocking element there's nothing to hype it and no matter how much fanboys exaggerate it, the neutral audience gonna show them the real world. Well, i belong to the neutral club so here i am telling the truth, no hatred, no fanship, no soft corner or anything like that. To be frank and i am not being too harsh but we gotto wait for the upcoming episodes to see where it's heading to? Useless speculations and verdicts are pointsless at the moment. For now enjoy the comedic homage to past sitcoms and wait for the next episodes. The first episode of WandaVision is more humanly funny than the second one whereas the second one has got better humour than the first one. I was bit disappointed with the conclusive parts not being strongly held but thanks to the typical romedy that makes it enjoyable."
27 June 2022,"It's not bad, definitely could've been better.",6.0,"""First"" attempt to put the MCU heroes in the TV format. It's not too shabby but it way felt way more like a chopped film than a TV series, the 7-minute credits don't help with that.

The interaction between Vision and Wanda is key here, that should've been the focal point here without all the necessary fluff that they did with adding the random villains (looking at you Hayward) and Pietro for some reason, I mean the only reason Pietro was there was to get Wanda to ""expose"" her secret for Agatha, too tacky imo.

Agatha herself is a great concept but a whole season could've been devoted to her, she just comes in for no reason, and then goes out for no reason. It's the thing they are doing for the movies too but at this point break your formula, you don't need it for the TV shows (or the movies at this point but that's a different topic)

Overall, if they work more on making these shows FEEL like a show rather than a movie by not following the movie formula they have, they could be on to something here."
17 January 2021,Ok,6.0,Definitely think this should have been released all together in 1 season. The first episode was losing me and I started fast forwarding to better parts of the show. I did the same thing in the 2nd episode. I think I know what's happening now but I literally almost stopped watching after the first episode like someone else said. Hoping it gets better with more action and excitement.
1 July 2022,Interesting and fresh for half a season,6.0,"It was so interesting and fresh up until the middle of the season, then it went into the usual Marvel route that we've all seen before and lost a lot of its charm."
22 May 2022,Overrated show,4.0,"Concept is good, but execution is poor, it's an over rated show.

Disney made this show coz just the concept seems too good. Story line is too slow and boring. Only after episode 4 story moves a bit forward."
